                    <p>"The Two Hunters," "The Orphan Boy," "The Fox," and "Canktewin&#8212;the
                        Ill-Fated Woman," were translated by Miss Julia LaFramboise, a teacher and
                        missionary in the Santee Normal Training School. "The Spider and the ducks"

                    <p>As published in the <orgName ref="trb.001">Santee</orgName> missionary paper,
                        the translations were very rough and made no attempt at literary style.
                        Consequently they have been subject to considerable editing to clarify their
                        meaning, although every attempt has been made to retain the simple, almost
                        childlike style of the <orgName ref="trb.001">Santee</orgName> original.</p>
                    <p>Like most Indian legends, these have lost a great deal of their original
                        charm and interest in translation and in print. So much of their effect
                        depends upon the gestures of the story-teller and their natural setting.</p>

                    <p>The <persName ref="per.009">Spider</persName> [<orgName ref="trb.001"
                            >Santee</orgName> name for evil spirit] was searching for food on the
                        plains when he came to the base of a high hill. Thinking to find food at its
                        top, he laboriously climbed one of its steep sides. When he reached his
                        destination he saw before him a large lake which stretched from the base of
                        the hill into the distance as far as the eye could see. Many <persName
                            ref="per.014">ducks</persName> were floating on its shiny surface. The
                            <persName ref="p.009">Spider</persName>, becoming ravenously hungry<pb
                            xml:id="p002" facs="nefl.21.002.jpg"/> at sight of the <name

                                <orig>water fowl</orig>

                            </choice></name>, began to scheme how he could get some of them to eat.
                        Finally, after some minutes of thought, a plan came to him. He descended to
                        the base of the hill, where he had started, and gathered a bundle of hay
                        which he carried to the hilltop.</p>
                    <p>This time he stood erect on the hilltop so that all the <name type="animal"
                            >ducks</name> could see him; one of them said: "Hello, old <name
                            type="animal">Spider</name>, what do you carry on your back?" "Songs,"
                        replied the <persName ref="p.009">Spider</persName>. To this remark they all
                        answered, "You had better come down and sing to us." The <name type="animal"
                            >Spider</name> immediately accepted their invitation and descended to
                        the lake shore near the <persName ref="per.014">ducks</persName>, where he
                        proceeded to fashion a lodge from the hay he was carrying. When he had
                        finished the lodge he invited the <persName ref="per.014">ducks</persName>
                        to come in and sit down. It took a long time for the <persName ref="per.014"
                            >ducks</persName> to get in because there were so many of them.</p>
                    <p>When all of the <persName ref="per.014">ducks</persName> were seated the
                            <persName ref="per.009">Spider</persName> closed the door and told them
                        to shut their eyes. Then he began to sing:</p>
                    <lg type="song">
                        <l>"Whoever opens his eyes</l>
                        <l>Must have red eyes, red eyes,</l>
                        <l>Whoever opens his eyes</l>
                        <l>Must have red eyes, red eyes,</l>
                        <l>Whoever opens his eyes must have red eyes."</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>The <persName ref="per.014">ducks</persName> liked the song and began dancing
                        to its tune. The <persName ref="p.009">Spider</persName> kept on singing; at
                        the same time he went from one <persName ref="per.014">ducks</persName> to
                        another and twisted off its neck, until the necks of half the <persName
                            ref="per.014">ducks</persName> in the lodge had been twisted off. Then
                        he came to a <persName ref="per.015">swan</persName>, who had been visiting
                        the <persName ref="per.014">ducks</persName> on the lake and had followed
                        his companions into the lodge to hear the <persName ref="per.009"
                            >Spider</persName> sing, and attempted to twist his head off. But the
                            <name type="animal">swan's</name> neck was too long and strong for the
                            <persName ref="p.009">Spider</persName> to break it off. So the
                            <persName ref="per.015">swan</persName>, who was badly frightened, said,
                        "Quack! quack!" One of the young <persName ref="per.014">ducks</persName>,
                        upon hearing this warning, opened his eyes and at once saw many dead
                            <persName ref="per.014">ducks</persName> in the lodge. He cried out in
                        alarm: "Open your eyes, all of you, the <persName ref="p.009"
                            >Spider</persName> has killed almost the entire flock!" All of the
                        remaining <persName ref="per.014">ducks</persName> opened their eyes when
                        they heard what had happened to their companions. Their eyes immediately
                        became red, as the <persName ref="p.009">Spider</persName> had said they
                        would. This is the reason why <persName ref="per.014">ducks</persName>, to
                        this day, always have red eyes.</p>

                    <p>A <persName ref="per.016">fox</persName>, who had spent many days searching
                        for something to eat, was on the point of starvation when he came to a large
                        tent of buffalo skins. Although at first afraid to venture into the tent, in
                        which he could hear two men were talking, his hunger finally compelled him
                        to do so. The first thing he saw, after he had entered, was a pot of venison
                        cooking over a fire. On either side of the fire sat two old blind men; they
                        were discussing old times while waiting for their meat to be cooked. The
                            <persName ref="per.016">fox</persName>, perceiving that they were blind,
                        grew bolder and, seeing a rib sticking out of the pot, slyly took it out and
                        picked off the meat. Then he took another and<pb xml:id="p003"
                            facs="nefl.21.003.jpg"/> still another, until nothing was left but a
                        pile of bare rib bones. These he replaced in the pot.</p>
                    <p>At last one of the blind men said, "Well, I think this meat must be done." He
                        removed the pot from the fire but found it contained nothing but bones. He
                        then said to the other old man, "You artful, good-for-nothing fellow: You
                        thought to cheat me out of my dinner." The other man, in great surprise at
                        the accusation of his companion, became enraged. Each accused the other of
                        being the guilty one, in load and angry tones. The <persName ref="per.016"
                            >fox</persName> meanwhile took up a stick and, going very stealthily up
                        to one of them, struck him with it. The blind man at once turned and accused
                        the other man of striking him. The <persName ref="per.016">fox</persName>
                        then struck the other man. Both blind men thereupon flew at each other in
                        great wrath, which so excited the <name type="animal">fox</name> that he
                        giggled. The blind men ceased fighting and enquired who had come. The
                            <persName ref="per.016">fox</persName>, smoothing his face, answered, "A
                        traveler."</p>
                    <p>The old men, very much ashamed of their quarrel with each other, resumed
                        their respective places and welcomed the stranger. They told him to partake
                        of the dried <name type="animal">buffalo</name> meat which was packed away
                        in skins in great piles around the tent. The <persName ref="per.016"
                            >fox</persName> accepted their invitation and ate until he could eat no
                        more. Then said the old men, "If you are without provisions for the way,
                        take one of the sacks of buffalo meat." So the <persName ref="per.016"
                            >fox</persName> selected the largest and went on his way rejoicing. The
                        meat was so good, however, that he stopped every little while to eat. Very
                        soon he had nothing left but the skin in which the meat was packed; this he
                        rationed out so it would last for two days. When the last mouthful of this
                        was gone he was as famished as ever.</p>
                    <p>One day, when he thought he would die of hunger, he saw a fat <name
                            type="animal">buffalo</name> feeding on the green grass. The <persName
                            ref="per.016">fox</persName> immediately hid in the tall grass, and was
                        trying to devise some way of killing the <persName ref="per.017"
                            >buffalo</persName> when the animal looked up and saw him. He said,
                        "What do you want, my young brother?" The <persName ref="per.016"
                            >fox</persName> came forward and answered, "Ah! my brother, you see how
                        starved I am. Oh, that I were a <name type="animal">buffalo</name> so I
                        could feed on green grass and grow fat like you!" The <persName
                            ref="per.017">buffalo</persName>, hearing his wish, replied, "Would you
                        indeed be a <name type="animal">buffalo</name> if you could?" Since you
                        would be, you shall. Do you see yonder knoll? Go and sit upright on it and I
                        will come up the hill and jump over you." The <persName ref="per.016"
                            >fox</persName> obeyed the <name type="animal">buffalo</name> and took
                        his position. The <name type="animal">buffalo</name>, with staring eyes and
                        foaming mouth, came galloping up the hill, frightening the <persName
                            ref="per.016">fox</persName> so much that he jumped to one side. The
                            <persName ref="per.017">buffalo</persName> said, "You have now spoiled
                        it all. You can never be a <name type="animal">buffalo</name> if you don't
                        sit still and let me jump over you." The <persName ref="per.016"
                            >fox</persName> was very penitent and promised to sit still the next
                        time if the <name type="animal">buffalo</name> would try once more. Again
                        the <persName ref="per.016">fox</persName> sat on the knoll, but when he saw
                        the <name type="animal">buffalo</name> coming at him so fiercely he jumped
                        aside a second time. The <persName ref="per.017">buffalo</persName>, now
                        angry, said, "Since you are such a coward it is best that you remain a
                        half-starved <persName ref="per.016">fox</persName>." But the <persName
                            ref="per.016">fox</persName> entreated him to try once more. This time
                        the <persName ref="per.016">fox</persName> sat still. The <name
                            type="animal">buffalo</name>, as he jumped over him, knocked him over
                        with his hoof, causing the <persName ref="per.016">fox</persName> to tumble
                        down the hill. When the <persName ref="per.016">fox</persName> got up from
                        his fall he was a <name type="animal">buffalo</name>. He immediately began
                        to eat the green grass, which grew profusely in the vicinity.</p>
                    <p><title>Part II</title></p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="p.009">Spider</persName> [Evil spirit] was hunting in the
                        prairie with a quiver full of weeds and a tall weed for a bow. During his
                        hunt he met the <name type="animal">buffalo</name>, to<pb xml:id="p004"
                            facs="nefl.21.004.jpg"/> whom he said, "Why, the last time I saw you,
                        you were a poor hungry <persName ref="per.016">fox</persName>." The
                            <persName ref="per.016">fox</persName> then told him how a kind <name
                            type="animal">buffalo</name> had turned him into a <name type="animal"
                            >buffalo</name> so that he might not be hungry as long as there was
                        grass to eat. <persName ref="per.009">Unktomi</persName> [the Evil Spirit]
                        answered, "This, indeed, has been a hard year. Famine is in all the land.
                        Turn me into a <name type="animal">buffalo</name> that I may not be hungry."
                        "Well," said the good natured <persName ref="per.016">fox</persName>, "get
                        up on yonder knoll and I will jump over you." <persName ref="per.009"
                            >Unktomi</persName> did as he was told, but when he saw the <persName
                            ref="per.016">fox-buffalo</persName> running toward him he jumped aside.
                        The <persName ref="per.016">fox</persName>-<name type="animal"
                            >buffalo</name> then said, "You will never be a <name type="animal"
                            >buffalo</name> if you are such a coward." <persName ref="per.009"
                            >Unktomi</persName> sat down on the knoll again, and as the <persName

                    <p>Two hunters started out form a camp on a day when the snow was deep and game
                        was scarce. One of them was successful in his chase, but the other <persName
                            ref="per.018">hunter</persName> did not succeed in finding any game.
                        When the fortunate <persName ref="per.019">man</persName> sat down on a log
                        to rest the other <persName ref="per.018">man</persName> came over to sit
                        beside him. They smoked their pipes and talked about the events of the day.
                        The unfortunate <persName ref="per.018">hunter</persName> expected,
                        according to the Indian hunters' courtesy, the successful <persName
                            ref="per.019">hunter</persName> to share his game with him. But the
                        successful <persName ref="per.019">hunter</persName>, after having smoked
                        his pipe, took up his <name type="animal">deer</name> and walked off without
                        further ceremony. This insult was deeply resented by the other <persName
                            ref="per.018">man</persName>, who decided to have revenge. He at once
                        resolved to kill the other hunter's <persName ref="per.020"
                            >daughter</persName>, as his Wakan [sacred medicines] would enable him
                        to do so without detection, since he was a medicine man.</p>
                    <p>When he came to his tent he opened his medicine bag and prayed to his gods to
                        send a disease that would immediately kill the successful hunter's <persName
                            ref="per.020">daughter</persName>. The prayer of hatred was answered and
                        the hunter's <persName ref="per.020">daughter</persName> died. The
                        successful <persName ref="per.019">hunter</persName>, who knew his <persName
                            ref="per.020">daughter</persName> had died from an unnatural death,
                        desired to find out who had caused her death. When she was laid on a
                        scaffold in the top of a tree (which was the way the <orgName ref="trb.001"
                            >Santee</orgName> buried their dead) he lay down beside her, knowing
                        that the <persName ref="per.018">man</persName> responsible for her death
                        would come in the night to cut off the tongue of his <persName ref="per.020"
                            >victim</persName>. He did not have to wait long. As soon as the sun had
                        gone down he heard a rushing sound like that of a whirlwind. A winged
                            <persName ref="per.018">man</persName> flew over him and lit beside his
                            <persName ref="per.020">daughter's</persName> corpse. The <persName
                            ref="per.019">father</persName> scanned the countenance of the <persName
                            ref="per.018">man</persName> who was preparing to cut out his <persName
                            ref="per.020">victim's</persName> tongue, and recognized the features of
                        the slighted <persName ref="per.018">hunter</persName>.</p>
                    <p>As the <persName ref="per.018">medicine man</persName> proceeded with his
                        terrible work he asked the corpse: "Do you still eat of your <persName
                            ref="per.019">father's</persName> venison?" Whereat the enraged
                            <persName ref="per.019">father</persName> seized him, saying, "Yes, she
                        still eats of it!" The struggle between the two powerful men was long and
                        terrible, but when the beams of the pale moon shot out from behind a cloud
                        the stricken <persName ref="per.019">father</persName> was avenged.</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="per.019">father</persName> of the dead <persName
                            ref="per.020">girl</persName> cut up the corpse of the <persName
                            ref="per.018">medicine man</persName> and took it home, where he told
                        his <persName ref="per.021">wife</persName> he had brought fresh meat for
                        her to<pb xml:id="p005" facs="nefl.21.005"/> put in the pot. After it was
                        put on to boil he called all the <persName ref="per.022">members</persName>
                        of the medicine fraternity to a feast. The <persName ref="per.019"
                            >host</persName> did not speak until after the last man was through
                        eating and the pipe was passed around the group. Then he said: "You all know
                        that my <persName ref="per.020">daughter</persName> has been killed by
                        medicine; 'tis useless to deny it." They all answered, "Yes." Then the
                            <persName ref="per.019">host</persName> went on: "My <persName
                            ref="per.020">daughter</persName> death was the work of one of your
                        fraternity, of one of your greatest <persName ref="per.022">medicine
                            men</persName>, whom I called to attend this feast and who did not come.
                        But I caught him, and it was of him you have made such a hearty meal. I am
                        avenged."</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="per.022">medicine men</persName> all looked grave as their
                            <persName ref="per.023">chief</persName> speaker stood up and said: "It
                        was just. Since he was so bungling as to be caught he deserves his
                        fate."</p>

                    <p>An old <persName ref="per.024">man</persName> lived with his <persName
                            ref="per.025">squaw</persName> and two daughters, for whom he used to
                        fetch wood. One day, when he was chopping wood, he heard some one whistling.
                        Upon looking around he saw, sitting by a distant tree, a <persName
                            ref="per.026">rabbit</persName> motioning for him to come over. The
                            <name type="animal">rabbit</name>, upon his approach, gave him an acorn
                        and told him to crack it open in his stable when he went home. The old
                            <persName ref="per.024">man</persName>, when he came to his stable, did
                        as he was told. To his surprise a wagon came out of the acorn.</p>
                    <p>The next day, when again he went after wood, he met the same <persName
                            ref="per.026">rabbit</persName> who gave him another acorn. This time it
                        contained a harnessed team of <name type="animal">horses</name>.</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="per.026">rabbit</persName> on the third day gave him an
                        acorn that was to be cracked open in the tepee. It contained a pack full of
                        clothes for his two daughters.</p>
                    <p>The old <persName ref="per.024">man</persName> told his daughters on the
                        morning after they had received their clothes that there was a young
                            <persName ref="per.026">man</persName> who had been very good to him and
                        wanted to know which one of his daughters would marry him. They both thought
                        they would like to. The old <persName ref="per.024">man</persName> went to
                        the tree and found the <persName ref="per.026">rabbit</persName> and asked
                        him to come home with him. The <persName ref="per.026">rabbit</persName>,
                        now very bashful, did not want to go. So the old <persName ref="per.024"
                            >man</persName> picked him up, put him in the wagon and took him home by
                        force. When they got there he took the <persName ref="per.026"
                            >rabbit</persName> out, carried him into the house and said to his
                        daughters, "Here he is." The daughters looked at the <persName ref="per.026"
                            >rabbit</persName> and said they did not want him. This made the
                            <persName ref="per.026">rabbit</persName> feel ashamed, so he crept
                        under the bed. Before long he crawled out as a young <persName ref="per.026"
                            >man</persName>, dressed in grey clothes. Then they both wanted to marry
                        him. But the <persName ref="per.027">younger</persName> one said to the
                            <persName ref="per.028">older</persName>, "You must not marry him,
                        because you hate him so." So the <persName ref="per.027">younger
                            daughter</persName> and the young <persName ref="per.026">man</persName>
                        were married.</p>
                    <p>After they were married the young <persName ref="per.026">man</persName>
                        cracked an acorn which caused a large tent to rise up a short distance form
                        where the old people lived. The young couple moved into this tent, which was
                        completely furnished. The only request the young <persName ref="per.026"
                            >man</persName> made of his bride was that he should not be called
                            "<persName ref="per.026">Rabbit</persName>," but "<persName
                            ref="per.026">Casko</persName>." She complied with his request and
                        called him <persName ref="per.026">Casko</persName>,<pb xml:id="p006"
                            facs="nefl.21.006.jpg"/>but one day she forgot and called him <persName
                            ref="per.026">Rabbit</persName>. This made him so angry that he left
                        her. She felt very badly and cried for many days.</p>
                    <p> At last one day she put on her finest dress, prepared some lunch, and went
                        away. The first person she met on her journey was an old <persName
                            ref="per.029">woman</persName> who lived in a grass tent. The old
                            <persName ref="per.029">woman</persName> said, "<persName ref="per.027"
                            >Grandchild</persName>, whoever you are, come in." When she went in the
                        old <persName ref="per.029">woman</persName> took a handful of wild beans
                        from under some hay, and a few pieces of dried-out tallow, which she gave to
                        her for her meal. After she was through eating, the old <persName
                            ref="per.029">woman</persName> asked her where she was going. The
                            <persName ref="per.027">girl</persName> answered, "Nowhere in
                        particular: I am just walking around." Then the old <persName ref="per.029"
                            >woman</persName> said, "No, <persName ref="per.027"
                            >Grandchild</persName>, I know where you are going and what you are
                        going for, but I prefer my <persName ref="per.030">sister</persName> to tell
                        you."</p>
                    <p>The old <persName ref="per.029">woman</persName> told her where to find her
                            <persName ref="per.030">sister</persName>, who lived down the road in
                        another grass tent.</p>
                    <p>But the second old <persName ref="per.030">woman</persName> did as the first
                        one had done--gave her beans and tallow to eat, asked her the same
                        questions, and told her to go to her sister who lived still farther down the
                        road. She visited five old women, all sisters, who lived in grass tents and
                        gave her wild beans and tallow to eat, and asked her the same questions. The
                        only exception was the fifth <persName ref="per.031">sister</persName>, who
                        said, "You are going after your <persName ref="per.026">husband</persName>
                        who is not far from here. God down the road until you come to a place where
                        some young <persName ref="per.032">women</persName> are washing and laughing
                        as they wash. Among their clothes you will find those that belong to your
                            <persName ref="per.026">husband</persName>. Take them with you. These
                        young <persName ref="per.032">women</persName> will tell you where your
                            <persName ref="per.026">husband</persName> is."</p>
                    <p>She followed the old <persName ref="per.031">woman's</persName> directions
                        and found the place where the young <persName ref="per.032">women</persName>
                        were washing. Here she saw <persName ref="per.026">Casko's</persName>
                        clothing and asked the young <persName ref="per.032">women</persName> if
                        they could tell her where <persName ref="per.026">Casko</persName> was. They
                        replied that he had gone to a dance where he was going to be married. They
                        directed her to the dance, where she found <persName ref="per.026"
                            >Casko</persName> dancing with a very pretty girl. She watched them for
                        a long time, until <persName ref="per.026">Casko</persName> turned around
                        and saw his <persName ref="per.027">wife</persName> looking at him. He came
                        over to her and took her away from the people. When they were alone he took
                        an acorn out of his pocket and cracked it. It contained clothes for his
                            <persName ref="per.027">wife</persName>, as hers were all ragged from
                        her travels. <persName ref="per.026">Casko</persName> cracked another acorn
                        and got <name type="animal">horses</name> and a wagon. They then rode home,
                        where they lived happily together for a long time.</p>

                        becoming tired of his surroundings, he got into a large canoe and paddled
                        out to sea. A terrible storm came up and cast him upon a lonely island,
                        where he lived in solitude until one day a large canoe, containing several
                            <persName ref="per.034">men</persName>, landed. They told the <persName
                            ref="per.033">boy</persName>, who met them at the beach, that they were
                        going to a distant shore where there was a well which, when salt was thrown
                        into it, would create gold. The <persName ref="per.034">men</persName> had
                        their canoe filled with salt for that purpose. The <persName ref="per.033"
                            >boy</persName> was glad to take passage with them.</p>
                    <p>They were on the ocean many days before they came to the well. When<pb
                            xml:id="p007" facs="nefl.21.007.jpg"/> they arrived they threw in their
                        salt and got a great deal of gold, yet they wanted more. So they sent the
                        orphan <persName ref="per.033">boy</persName> down in a sack, in spite of
                        his cries and screams, threatening to keep him in the bottom of the well
                        until he had filled the sack with gold. They used all their ropes in an
                        attempt to get him to the bottom of the well; then they fastened poles
                        together. At length, after many poles had been fastened together, the
                            <persName ref="per.033">boy</persName> reached the bottom of the well
                        where he found many gold coins at the mouth of a huge cave. He filled two
                        sacks with coins, and attached them to a rope with himself on the top of the
                        sack. After this had been done he signaled to the <persName ref="per.034"
                            >men</persName> at the top by jerking the rope that he was ready to
                        ascend. They commenced to pull him up. He was almost within reach of the
                        mouth of the well when the rope and poles gave way, letting the <persName
                            ref="per.033">boy</persName> drop to the bottom of the well again.</p>
                    <p>When the <persName ref="per.033">boy</persName> recovered consciousness he
                        heard a great noise above him which sounded like a whirlwind. To his terror
                        he found that it was coming nearer down the well. He crept into the large
                        sack, but was soon conscious of being carried upward, past the mouth of the
                        well and high into the air. He now knew for certain that he was the captive
                        of a large <name type="animal">bird</name>. After what seemed to be ages he
                        was put down. When he crept out of the bag he saw that he was in an <name
                            type="animal">eagle's</name> nest</p>
                    <p>The old <name type="animal">eagle</name> was about to tear him to pieces but,
                        seeing the <persName ref="per.033">boy's</persName> wretchedness, took
                        compassion on him and brooded him with her young. The nest was in the top of
                        a very tall cottonwood tree which stood alone on a plain. One day when the
                        old <name type="animal">eagle</name> was gone he commenced climbing down the
                        tree. It took him a long time to slide down, and when he reached the ground
                        he was scarcely able to move. The branches had torn his clothes and skin so
                        badly that his flesh was exposed and raw. Yet he knew it would be certain
                        death to remain where he was, so he crept away, rested for a while, and
                        moved on a little further, until he reached a river, where he quenched his
                        thirst. Shortly after he came to the river two beautiful young <persName
                            ref="per.035">women</persName> appeared along the river bank and took
                        compassion on him. They bound up his wounds and fed him; and when he was
                        able to walk they took him home with them.</p>
                    <p>They lived in a splendid palace with many hundreds of rooms in it, each
                        filled with curious and beautiful things from all parts of the world. Here
                        they took care of him until he was well again. After he was well they
                        adopted him for their brother, and for the first time the poor <persName
                            ref="per.033">boy</persName> was very happy.</p>
                    <p>One day his <persName ref="per.035">sisters</persName> told him they were
                        going away from home for the day. Before they left they told him he could
                        amuse himself in any portion of the house with the exception of one room,
                        which he was never to enter. Then, after giving him the keys to the place,
                        they departed. He went from room to room, admiring the many beautiful things
                        he saw. When night came his <persName ref="per.035">sisters</persName> had
                        not returned and he had not yet seen all the rooms in the palace.</p>
                    <p>The next day he went over the other rooms. At length he came to the forbidden
                        room, where he paused a long time on the threshold. He put the key into the
                        key-hole, then pulled it out with a shudder at thought of the possible
                        consequences, and passed on. Yet when he had seen all the other rooms he
                        returned to the forbidden one. This time he opened it and saw a fiery <name
                            type="animal"><choice>
                                <orig>steed</orig>
                                <reg>horse</reg>
                            </choice></name>, milk white with golden markings, wonderously
                        beautiful. Its<pb xml:id="p008" facs="nefl.21.008.jpg"/> eyes flashed as he
                        led it from the palace and mounted it.</p>
                    <p>He had scarcely gotten firmly seated before the <name type="animal"
                            >horse</name> flew into the air with the <persName ref="per.033"
                            >boy</persName> on its back. The speed of its flight took his breath
                        away and he fainted. When he recovered consciousness he was lying wounded
                        and bleeding on the sea-shore. Raising his head, he looked around and
                        recognized the place from whence he had embarked months before. An old
                            <persName ref="per.036">woman</persName> came along and took him to her
                        home, where he told her of his experiences. She immediately re-told his tale
                        to the great <persName ref="per.037">chief</persName> of the town, who had
                        him brought to his palace for an interview. After he had told his story a
                        second time the <persName ref="per.037">chief</persName> said: "Those young
                            <persName ref="per.035">women</persName> that you call <persName
                            ref="per.035">sisters</persName> are my long lost <persName
                            ref="per.035">daughters</persName>. They were carried away by a man one
                        day, years ago, when they were swimming. The <name type="animal"
                            >horse</name> that flew away with you is my long lost <name
                            type="animal">horse</name>. When he came near home he left you by the
                        seashore, where you were found. Through you I have gotten back my beautiful
                            <name type="animal">horse</name>, and he has told me where my <persName
                            ref="per.035">daughters</persName> can be found."</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="per.037">chief</persName> sent men in canoes after his
                            <persName ref="per.035">daughters</persName>. There was great rejoicing
                        in the town on the day when they were returned. The lonely orphan <persName
                            ref="per.033">boy</persName> became the <persName ref="per.037"
                            >Chief's</persName> son, and was made chief over all the warriors in the
                        country.</p>

                    <p>Once there was a large village in which lived an honorable <persName
                            ref="per.038">man</persName> who was called to all the great feasts. He
                        took an active part in the dances to the Sun and to the <persName
                            ref="per.010">Heyoka</persName> [anti-natural deity]. He had ten
                            <persName ref="per.039">sons</persName>, all of whom were handsome
                        braves, and two fair daughters.</p>
                    <p>Now, as <name type="season">spring</name> drew near, and according to their
                        usual custom, they started out on their <name type="season">spring</name>
                        hunt. The young <persName ref="per.039">braves</persName> took their two
                        sisters with them. The five eldest <persName ref="per.039"
                            >brothers</persName> were to hunt game for the elder <persName
                            ref="per.041">sister</persName>, and the other five for the younger
                            <persName ref="per.008">sister</persName>. After traveling a long
                        distance they selected their camping ground. Day by day the <persName
                            ref="per.039">brothers</persName> vied with one another in bringing to
                        their sisters the choicest game.</p>
                    <p>As time went on the younger <persName ref="per.008">sister</persName>, who
                        was the more amiable of the two, became the favorite. To her white deer-skin
                        tent came the choicest game of forest and lake. So, in consequence, jealousy
                        grew in the breast of the elder <persName ref="per.041">sister</persName>.
                        One morning, after the departure of her <persName ref="per.039"
                            >brothers</persName>, she decked herself in fine clothes and trinkets,
                        after which she picked up an ax and told her <persName ref="per.008"
                            >sister</persName> that she was going to get firewood. She followed the
                        well-worn path of her <persName ref="per.039">brothers</persName> through
                        the forest until she came to a tall tree, where she perched herself among
                        its thick branches. There she waited until evening, when her eldest brother
                        came in sight, heavily laden with a <name type="animal">deer</name>. As he
                        passed beneath her she struck his head a blow with her ax that broke his
                        skull. Then she descended from the tree and dragged him into the bushes,
                        after which she resumed her hiding place before the second<pb xml:id="p009"
                            facs="nefl.21.009"/> brother appeared. She disposed of him in the same
                        manner, and the same with the next and the next, until all of the ten
                            <persName ref="per.039">brothers</persName> were killed. Then she went
                        home to her <persName ref="per.008">sister</persName> and affected great
                        distress and uneasiness for their non-appearance. The really distressed
                        younger <persName ref="per.008">sister</persName> looked in vain for their
                        coming that night.</p>
                    <p>Next morning the younger <persName ref="per.008">girl</persName>, upon
                        awakening, saw that her <persName ref="per.041">sister</persName> was busy
                        out doors by the fire. To her horror she saw that her <persName
                            ref="per.041">sister</persName> had the ten heads of her murdered
                            <persName ref="per.039">brothers</persName>; she was scalping them and
                        sewing together the scalps for a mantle. Then she heard her exclaim: "What
                        shall I do? I lack just one scalp of finishing my beautiful mantle. O! I'll
                        complete it with my <persName ref="per.008">sister's</persName> scalp!" The
                        younger <persName ref="per.008">sister</persName>, upon hearing these words,
                        fled in terror from the tent to the deepest recess of the forest, where she
                        wailed out her anguish, calling on the <persName ref="per.042"
                            >Wanaghis</persName> [ghosts] to avenge her lost <persName ref="per.039"
                            >brothers</persName>.</p>
                    <p>When night came and darkness spread over the earth her attention was
                        attracted by a low whistle, then another whistle, longer and louder; then
                        one to the north of her; then another to the east; then to the south and to
                        the east; then to the south of west. Afterward came a stillness that even
                        the insects dared not disturb, while close by her voice said, "<persName
                            ref="per.008">Sister</persName>, it is your murdered <persName
                            ref="per.039">brothers</persName> that whistled. Go home and go to bed!
                        In the night you will hear whistling, as you did just now, but fear not.
                        When you hear this whistling your elder <persName ref="per.041"
                            >sister</persName> will say, 'My <persName ref="per.008"
                            >sister</persName>, get up and light the fire,' but do not heed her
                        though she implores you to get up."</p>
                    <p>So she went home, where her <persName ref="per.041">sister</persName> still
                        worked on the scalp mantle. After awhile they both retired. They were
                        awakened at midnight by the whistling. At the first sound the elder
                            <persName ref="per.041">sister</persName> called to the younger, whose
                        name was <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName>, and entreated her to
                        light the fire. But <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> slept until
                        morning. When she awakened she found that her <persName ref="per.041"
                            >sister</persName> was already up and about. When <persName
                            ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> came out of the tent her <persName
                            ref="per.041">sister</persName> cried angrily at her, "Go back, or I
                        will kill you with this!" wielding a human leg. It was one of her own legs
                        that the ghost of one of her <persName ref="per.039">brothers</persName> had
                        pulled off. The elder <persName ref="per.041">sister's</persName> face had
                        become so distorted during the night that <persName ref="per.008"
                            >Canktewin</persName> found it difficult to recognize her. The elder
                            <persName ref="per.041">sister</persName>, after threatening <persName
                            ref="per.008">Canktewin's</persName> life, sat down again, muttering to
                        herself in the manner of witches. At length she arose and hopped off on one
                        leg, carrying the other one under her arm.</p>
                    <p>The elder <persName ref="per.041">sister</persName> had hardly gotten out of
                        sight before <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> left the tent and
                        fled for her life. She ran until out of breath, but when she paused to rest
                        she heard a voice in the distance which she recognized as her <persName
                            ref="per.041">sister's</persName>, who was pursuing her. Upon looking
                        back <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> saw the unsightly creature
                        hopping toward her at the rate of one or two yards at a hop, with her scalp
                        mantle streaming behind her. She had nearly overtaken the helpless <persName
                            ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> when they encountered a small swamp.
                        The one-legged creature, in trying to extricate herself from the mire,
                        pulled the other leg off. Unable to proceed further, she died there.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> came to the
                        shore of a beautiful lake. Off in the distance, on the surface of the lake,
                        gleamed something which, when it came closer to the bank, proved to be a
                        metal canoe with a single <persName ref="per.040">boatman</persName>. She
                        hid in the bushes, but was too late to escape the sight of<pb xml:id="p010"
                            facs="nefl.21.010"/> the <persName ref="per.040">boatman</persName>, for
                        he landed just below her, walked up to her hiding place and commanded her to
                        get into his canoe. But when she began to step into the canoe she saw a
                        hundred <name type="animal">snakes</name> in its prow, each of which hissed
                        at her. She drew back in terror, only to be driven forward by her <persName
                            ref="per.040">captor</persName>. Again the <name type="animal"
                            >snakes</name> jumped toward her. When their <persName ref="per.040"
                            >master</persName> commanded them to be silent they obeyed him, and
                            <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> got into the canoe and
                        seated herself among them. The <persName ref="per.040">man</persName> then
                        got in and paddled until the sun was on the west side, when they came in
                        sight of a very high precipice. As the canoe drew nearer a door flew open
                        and the <persName ref="per.040">man</persName> ordered her to get out. She
                        stepped into a great stone hall, where a little old <persName ref="per.043"
                            >woman</persName> was sitting by a huge fire and an immense pot
                        containing a stew.</p>
                    <p>Next morning, as the <persName ref="per.040">man</persName> was starting out
                        in his metal canoe, he said to the old <persName ref="per.043"
                            >woman</persName>, "<persName ref="per.043">Grandmother</persName>, have
                        another stew ready on my return." After his departure the old <persName
                            ref="per.043">woman</persName> wept and said, "O, my <persName
                            ref="per.008">grandchild</persName>, why did you come here to the
                            <persName ref="per.040">man-eater's</persName> house? This <persName
                            ref="per.040">man</persName> has eaten a great many young men and women,
                        and you are the fairest of them all. I cannot kill you. Take this tomahawk
                        and cleave open this old head of mine. My life has been long but what use is
                        it to me now? Take my body, put it into the pot and make a savory stew for
                        the <persName ref="per.040">man-eater</persName>. Then take my severed arms
                        and the ax to yonder island, tie them to a tree, and fly for your life. Go
                        toward the east; run night and day until you come to a bright metal
                        house."</p>
                    <p>Poor <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> wrung her hands in agony
                        and said, "I cannot! O! I cannot! It is better that you do your work and
                        kill me."</p>
                    <p>"Ah! my <persName ref="per.008">grandchild</persName>," said the old
                            <persName ref="per.043">woman</persName>, "it would be but one of your
                        kindest acts to take me away from this den to the happy land of the spirits,
                        where all my kind have preceded me. I am nothing but a lightning-blasted
                        tree whose center has been rotted out with age. Take, O take, my <persName
                            ref="per.008">grandchild</persName>, this weapon and kill me." But her
                        pleadings were in vain. <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> would
                        not kill her. The old <persName ref="per.043">woman</persName> then threw
                        herself into the boiling pot.</p>
                    <p><persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName>, upon seeing what the old
                            <persName ref="per.043">woman</persName> had done, became horrified and
                        wept until the dealing sun reminded her that she must escape before the
                            <persName ref="per.040">man-eater</persName> returned. But before
                        leaving she severed the arms of the old <persName ref="per.043"
                            >woman</persName>, which, together with the ax, she carried to the
                        island where she tied them to a tree. Then she fled.</p>
                    <p>Soon after her flight the <persName ref="per.040">man-eater</persName>
                        returned to find his <persName ref="per.043">grandmother</persName> gone. In
                        answer to his call he heard her voice from the far off island. Again he
                        called. This time he heard her answer that she would come as soon as the
                        wood was chopped. He sat down to wait, listening to the strokes of her ax.
                        After awhile he became angry at her delay and started after her. When he
                        arrived at the island he found only her arms, which were chopping wood. He
                        knew then that <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> had escaped. His
                        anger was so great that he foamed at the mouth as he started in pursuit.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> ran night and
                        day until suddenly a bright light dazzled her eyes. After she had become
                        used to the strange light she discerned a metal house. Her limbs by now were
                        so tired that she could scarcely stand up. But she was quickly aroused from
                        her pause by a yell of rage. Turning around she saw the <persName
                            ref="per.040">man-eater</persName> running toward her with a flashing
                        tomahawk in his hand. He was only a few steps behind her when she<pb
                            xml:id="p011" facs="nefl.21.011"/> reached the metal house, by the steps
                        of which sat a <persName ref="per.044">man</persName> carving a large pipe.
                        Carven images were fastened to his ears; they winked and blinked at her when
                        he turned his head. She cried, "Save me and I'll be your cousin!" Still he
                        was silent. She screamed in desperation, "Save me and I'll be your sister!"
                        The <persName ref="per.040">man-eater</persName> almost had her in his grasp
                        when the silent <persName ref="per.044">man</persName> sprang to his feet
                        and pushed her into his metal house. "Why did you not say you were my sister
                        before?" he asked.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime the <persName ref="per.040">man-eater</persName>, shouting
                        angrily at the top of his voice, kept running around the house. This annoyed
                        the silent <persName ref="per.044">man</persName>, so he said, "My pets, go
                        and eat him up; he troubles me." He opened a side door that let out a <name
                            type="animal">lion</name> and a <name type="animal">tiger</name> who
                        immediately sprung upon the <persName ref="per.040">man-eater</persName>,
                        tore him to pieces and commenced to devour him. But each piece that touched
                        the ground became a <persName ref="per.040">man-eater</persName>, and it was
                        only when they ate up the ground on which his blood dropped that they were
                        victorious.</p>
                    <p><title type="sub-title">Part II</title></p>
                    <p><persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> was very happy to become the
                        silent <persName ref="per.044">man's</persName> sister. The many rooms of
                        her <persName ref="per.044">brother's</persName> house were decorated with
                        braided belts, moccasins, quilled blankets and leggings. Some of the
                        articles were unfinished. "These," said her <persName ref="per.044"
                            >brother</persName>, as she was surveying them, "are the handiwork of my
                        former adopted sister, who was deceived and killed during my absence. Now I
                        am going to leave you, but do not, on any account, open the door to any one
                        while I am gone." So saying he set out on a journey to a far country.</p>
                    <p>One day, when <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> was working on one
                        of the unfinished belts, she heard a pleading voice at the door saying,
                        "Aunt, do let me in 'ere I perish with cold. I am the silent <persName
                            ref="per.044">man's</persName> child and he sent me to you." This
                        wailing voice repeated its demand for admittance at regular intervals until
                        her sympathizing heart could withstand it no longer. She admitted a small
                            <persName ref="per.045">boy</persName> with a large mouth. His strange
                        deformity made her shrink back, but when she remembered that it was her
                            <persName ref="per.044">protector's</persName>
                        <persName ref="per.045">child</persName> she led him to the fire and warmed
                        him, where he fell asleep. She sat and watched him. As he slept his mouth
                        opened wider and wider until she saw a man's foot coming out of his throat.
                        She immediately awoke the ugly creature, saying, "Get up, my nephew, and
                        fetch some wood; our fire is going out." As he stepped out she closed and
                        barred the door. The <persName ref="per.045">boy</persName>, who was but a
                            <persName ref="per.045">demon</persName> in disguise, saw that he had
                        been fooled. He raged and raved at the door for a long time, but it was to
                        no purpose. <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> would not let him
                        in a second time. When her <persName ref="per.044">brother</persName>
                        returned he praised her wisdom in escaping the wiles of such an <persName
                            ref="per.045">enemy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>She lived with her <persName ref="per.044">brother</persName> many happy
                        years, but after a time she began thinking of her lonely parents, bereft of
                        their children, and became seized with the desire to return and comfort
                        them. When she made known the cause of her unhappiness to her <persName
                            ref="per.044">brother</persName> he told her to go at once. But before
                        she left he gave her instructions on how to avoid the many danger she would
                        find on her journey.</p>
                    <p>One day, when she was traveling through a large village, she was chased by
                        the men, women, children and dogs who inhabited the place. But she looked
                        straight before her and did not heed their uproar. When she came to the
                        outskirts of the town there was a furious earthquake which nearly
                            swallowed<pb xml:id="p012" facs="nefl.21.012"/> her up. She ran, in
                        order to get away from the new danger, but on looking around saw a large
                        spotted <name type="animal">dog</name> which was fiercely pursuing her. She
                        was nearly out of breath when the <name type="animal">dog</name> also became
                        tired out and abandoned the pursuit.</p>
                    <p>Shortly afterwards she heard a child-like voice calling her name. She looked
                        around and spied a <persName ref="per.107">dwarf</persName> in the branches
                        of a tree. He tried in every way to make her speak. She had nearly passed
                        out of sight when his extreme insolence made her command him to be still.
                        Whereupon he came down and told her that she could not pass until she had
                        shot arrows with him. She shot arrows with him and lost them. He led the way
                        in the hunt for them until they came to an enclosure, where he told her she
                        was his slave. Looking around, she found every avenue of escape closed and
                        barred. All she could see was a large field, where hundreds of scalpless
                        young women were toiling. The <persName ref="per.107">dwarf</persName> left
                        her to give an offering to the <persName ref="per.011"
                            >Tahkushkanshkan</persName> [the motion god] for permitting him to find
                        another slave. When he was preparing for his ceremony he retired to his
                        round hut and called for <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> to
                        bring his heated stone. When she was handing it to him he pulled off her
                        scalp. After the <persName ref="per.107">dwarf</persName> finished his
                        offering he bound <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> and seated
                        her in the center of his round house.</p>
                    <p>After she had been seated there awhile she saw a large black stone slowly
                        descending toward her from the top of the roof. To save herself she threw up
                        her hand, in which was a small sharp stick. The stick pierced through the
                        soft center of the stone, which contained the <persName ref="per.107"
                            >dwarf's</persName> heart, immediately killing him. She then ran out to
                        the field and proclaimed freedom to the poor scalped creatures. They all
                        went to a nearby lake where they bathed their heads in the water. Their
                        scalps were immediately restored to their heads. Then she continued on her
                        way homeward, while the other slaves, after thanking her for freeing them
                        returned to theirs.</p>
                    <p>One day, while still on her journey, she walked along the shore of a lake,
                        where she met two young <persName ref="per.108">women</persName> who asked
                        her to bathe in the lake with them. Before doing so they informed her that
                        the fates had decreed that whoever dove up from beneath the surface of the
                        water in the center of the lake, which was marked by a tuft of wild rice,
                        would be taken as his wife by <persName ref="per.012"
                            >Wahmnuhahtahghosha</persName> [the Pearl Spitter]. <persName
                            ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> was the only one who succeeded in
                        coming up at the tuft of wild rice. Then they proceeded on their journey
                        together until they saw a beautiful canoe come to the shore, out of which a
                        young man stopped, saying, "I am the Pearl Spitter." Then, as <persName
                            ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> was getting ready to step into the
                        canoe, the two young <persName ref="per.108">women</persName> pushed her
                        aside and stepped in themselves.</p>
                    <p><persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> was now alone again. She
                        followed the lake's shore until another canoe came in sight. This was far
                        more beautiful than the first, and the <persName ref="per.012"
                            >boatman</persName> far more handsome than the other. He sprang ashore
                        and began to spit beautiful pearls of all sizes. This proved him to be the
                        real <persName ref="per.012">Pearl Spitter</persName>, the first one being
                        an impostor. She eagerly gathered the pearls. Then they entered the canoe
                        and paddled to the opposite side, where there was a large village, the
                            <persName ref="per.012">Pearl Spitter's</persName> home. Here they lived
                        in great happiness, until one evening, when there was a grand feast to which
                        they were both invited. While they were at the feast her two <persName
                            ref="per.108">rivals</persName> in the diving contest saw her with the
                        real <persName ref="per.012">Pearl Spitter</persName>; whereupon they were
                        filled with envy and jealousy. They followed the <persName ref="per.012"
                            >Pearl Spitter</persName> and his <persName ref="per.008"
                            >wife</persName> home,<pb xml:id="p013" facs="nefl.21.013.jpg"/> where
                        they drove <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> out of the house and
                        occupied it themselves. The counterfeit Pearl Spitter came in great wrath,
                        and called the real <persName ref="per.012">Pearl Spitter</persName> a
                        coward, whereupon they had a fight. They destroyed the village during this
                        struggle, also all the trees by the lake, and shook up the waters of the
                        lake so that it was never clear from that time on. But at length, by
                        cowardly wiles, the counterfeit Pearl Spitter overcame his noble antagonist.
                        Poor <persName ref="per.008">Canktewin</persName> stayed long enough to wail
                        over the grave, then went home and comforted her <persName ref="per.038"
                            >father</persName> and mother all the days of their lives.</p>
                    <p><title>The Meaning of the Myth</title></p>
                    <p>In the myth of "Canktewin, the Ill-Fated Woman," we have a peculiar character
                        study. The name, "Ill-Fated Woman," was chosen to express the original
                            <orgName ref="trb.001">Santee</orgName> meaning. <hi rend="underline"
                            >Canktewin</hi> gives only a part of the native idea. <hi
                            rend="underline">Cankte</hi> (the <hi rend="underline">win</hi> is the
                        feminine termination in proper names), in <orgName ref="trb.003"
                            >Dakota</orgName>, means a tree that has been blasted by lightning. It
                        is also used as an attribute to the great Thunder God, who kills the trees
                        by his flash. By figure of speech it seems to be used of this young woman
                        who, though amiable and full of good intent, always brings disaster on those
                        with whom she is connected, as well as on herself. But as for herself she
                        miraculously escapes every time, only to fall into new dangers and stir up
                        more trouble.</p>
                    <p>Thus by her amiability she captivates her <persName ref="per.039"
                            >brothers</persName> and arouses the jealousy of her <persName
                            ref="per.041">sister</persName>, causing the death of them all. She
                        falls into the hands of the <persName ref="per.040">man-eater</persName>,
                        only to cause the death of the good <persName ref="per.043"
                            >grandmother</persName> who befriends her and shows her how to escape.
                        She is nearly re-captured because she fails to say the right word in time.
                        She almost brings ruin to her new benefactor, the silent <persName
                            ref="per.044">man</persName>, and death to herself by opening his house
                        to the <persName ref="per.045">demon</persName>. On her road home, by
                        failing to keep still one moment longer, she falls into the hands of the
                        wicked <persName ref="per.107">dwarf</persName> and loses her scalp. And
                        later, as was seen in the second part of the story, she brings disaster on
                        her lover and the village and country in which he lives by the jealousy she
                        arouses in her rivals.</p>
                    <p>Consistently fortunate herself, she brings misfortune to the people who are
                        connected with her. True, she liberates the scalpless maidens toiling in the
                        fields of the wicked <persName ref="per.107">dwarf</persName>, and at last
                        goes home to cherish her parents in their last days. But these are only
                        incidents, and not main points of her life.</p>
                    <p>Doubtless other ideas, mythological and philosophical, may be traced in this
                        story. Its most evident meaning, however, is as a study in character.</p>

                    <p>Once <persName ref="per.009">Unktomi Evil Spirit</persName> was going along
                        the bank of a river when he saw a little <persName ref="per.109"
                            >beaver</persName> fast asleep on the shore. <persName ref="per.009"
                            >Unktomi</persName>, chuckling to himself, said, "Now I'll have some
                        fun." He took the bark from a nearby tree and with it carefully tied up the
                        little <persName ref="per.109">beaver</persName>. Then he carried it a long way
                            off<pb xml:id="p014" facs="nefl.21.014.jpg"/> to a high hill; where,
                        after untying it, he woke it up by asking, "Why <persName ref="per.109">brother</persName>, how did you get
                        here?"</p>
                    <p>The little <persName ref="per.109">beaver</persName>, half asleep and
                        thinking he was still by the river bank, turned over and attempted to dive
                        into what he thought was water. After making several attempts to dive into
                        the ground he opened his eyes and saw that he was a long way from home.
                        Meanwhile <persName ref="per.009">Unktomi</persName> laughed and laughed
                        until he nearly fell over.</p>
                    <p>It took the little <persName ref="per.109">beaver</persName> a long time to
                        get to the river. The grass had been burnt off and the soles of his feet
                        were out by the stubble. <persName ref="per.009">Unktomi</persName> followed
                        at a distance, making the most of his practical joke. After this occurrence
                            <persName ref="per.009">Unktomi</persName> traveled for many days. One
                        day when the weather was very warm he lay down to rest and fell asleep. The
                        little <persName ref="per.109">beaver</persName> found him asleep and said,
                        "Now I'll have my revenge."</p>
                    <p>He dug a tunnel form the nearby river which ran water to <persName
                            ref="per.009">Unktomi</persName>. The <persName ref="per.109"
                            >beaver</persName> kept on digging until there was a vast lake around
                        his enemy, with nothing but a small island on the center, on which <persName
                            ref="per.009">Unktomi</persName> slept. When the <persName ref="per.109"
                            >beaver</persName> finished he said to <persName ref="per.009"
                                >Unktomi</persName>, "Why my <persName ref="per.009">brother</persName>, how did you happen here?" This
                        question caused <persName ref="per.009">Unktomi</persName>, who was partly
                        aroused, to turn over. In doing so he splashed into the lake that the <name
                            type="animal">beaver</name> had built. The <persName ref="per.109"
                            >beaver</persName> left the vicinity before <persName ref="per.009"
                            >Unktomi</persName> came to the surface. His surprise was so great that
                        he was nearly drowned before he recovered his presence of mind. When he rose
                        to the surface he tried in vain to climb up on the little island. But with
                        every effort a piece of the earth would cave in until the island was
                        completely demolished. Then, nearly exhausted, he struck out for the shore,
                        reaching it shortly before his strength gave out. He stretched himself out
                        on the bank to rest. When he had recovered from his experience he looked
                        around to see if the little <persName ref="per.109">beaver</persName> was laughing
                        at him; and sure enough, there was his face grinning above the surface of
                        the water.</p>

                    <p><title><hi rend="all-caps">The Hunter</hi></title></p>
                    <p>In the olden days, long before the first pale-face set foot in this country,
                        a small band of Indians were camped near the <placeName ref="tgn_1110442"
                            >Cypress Hill</placeName>, where they were well supplied with wood and
                        water. There they had good pasture for their ponies, who were very scarce
                        and highly prized by the Indians. One of the Indians who lived in this
                        village, named <persName ref="per.013">Arrow-points</persName>, was a hunter who provided meat for his wife and
                        the little <persName ref="per.013">Arrow-points</persName> To do this he had to spend many days away from his
                        home, traveling great distances to secure sufficient game for his family's
                        needs. There, in strange hunting grounds, he was in constant danger of being
                        killed by the war parties of other tribes. In those days the only weapon was
                        the bow and arrow; he had to use a great deal of cunning in order to get
                        near enough to the game to kill it.</p>
                    <p>One day, when he was stalking a herd of <name type="animal">antelope</name>, he was surprised by a band
                        of <orgName ref="trb.002">Blackfeet Indians</orgName>, who were out on a <name type="animal"
                            >horse</name>-stealing expedition. <persName ref="per.013">Arrow-point</persName> had to run for his life. No
                        matter how fast he ran the <orgName ref="trb.002">Blackfeet</orgName> kept gaining on him, so it became
                        evident that unless some help came he would soon be slain. As he ran he
                        called on his feet, "Oh my feet, run, or I will be killed by our enemy," but
                        his feet answered back, "Call on your<pb xml:id="p015"
                            facs="nefl.21.015.jpg"/> head--when you eat you give all to your head
                        and never think of us." Again <persName ref="per.013">Arrow-point</persName> called out, "Oh my feet, run and I
                        shall always remember you when I eat." But still his feet remained stubborn.
                        So, seeing that all was lost, he threw himself on the ground and said, "All
                        right, when I am killed my head will be placed on a pole and all the
                        <orgName ref="trb.002">Blackfeet nation</orgName> will dance around and admire it, but you, you will be cut
                        off and thrown to the <name type="animal">dogs</name>." With that threat his
                        feet began to jump and hop, in a great fright to get away. He sprang to his
                        feet and flew over the ground, quickly out-distancing his pursuers.</p>
                    <p>He soon reached his home in safety, and in fulfillment of the promise to his
                        feet he had them bathed in buffalo fat for two days and nights. He was now
                        the swiftest runner in his tribe, often beating his companions' fastest
                            <name type="animal">horses</name>. The Indians changed his name to
                        <persName ref="per.013">Eagle-foot</persName>. Remembering his narrow escape from death, he always wiped his
                        hands on his feet when through eating. This is a custom that has been
                        observed by the Indians to this day.</p>
