                    <p>These legends are for the most part stories of the supernatural power
                        possessed by animals. The belief that animals had supernatural power did not
                        discount the power of a supreme being known to the <orgName ref="trb.004"
                            >Pawnee</orgName> as <persName ref="per.004">Tirawa</persName>. Within
                        their habitat the <orgName ref="trb.004">Pawnee</orgName> had certain places
                        which they held sacred. Five such places of importance in animal legend,
                        which were also known to other Indian tribes are <placeName

                    <p>There was once a little <orgName ref="trb.004">Pawnee</orgName>
                        <persName ref="per.110">boy</persName> who pretended that he was a <name
                            type="animal">bear</name>. Before he was born his father had come upon a
                        little <persName ref="per.111">bear</persName> cub while on the him. He did
                        not want to kill it or leave it because it cried after He said, "Child, you
                        are a <persName ref="per.005">Nahurac</persName>; <persName ref="per.004"
                            >Tirawa</persName> will take care of you. I hope that when my child is
                        born the <persName ref="per.005">Nahurac</persName> will take care of him."
                        When the man returned to the village he told his wife about the <persName
                            ref="per.111">bear</persName>.</p>
                    <p>This <persName ref="per.110">boy</persName> was like a <name type="animal"
                            >bear</name> because his father had petted it and told the mother about
                        it before he was born. As he grew up he became still more like a <name
                            type="animal">bear</name>. He told his friends jokingly that he could
                        turn himself into one.</p>
                    <p>When he became a man, he started out on the warpath, the leader of some
                        thirty-five others. They went up on the <placeName ref="tgn_2097516">Running
                            Water</placeName> and before they reached a village the <orgName

                    <p>The country in which this battle occurred was rocky and overgrown with cedar
                        trees. After the battle, two <name type="animal">bears</name> came along and
                        found the dead <orgName ref="trb.004">Pawnee</orgName> lying in a hollow.
                        The <persName ref="per.112">she-bear</persName> recognized the body of the
                            <persName ref="per.110">boy</persName> who was like a <name
                            type="animal">bear</name>. She called the <name type="animal"
                                ><orig>he-bear</orig></name> and pointed out the <persName
                            ref="per.110">man</persName>. She said, "Here is the <persName
                            ref="per.110">boy</persName> who imitated us and sang about us. Can you
                        help him?" The <persName ref="per.113">he-bear</persName> answered, "I will
                        try. I have more power `when the sun is shining on me." The day was cloudy
                        and cold and it was snowing, but now and then the clouds would pass and the
                        sun would come out for a little while.</p>
                    <p>The bears gathered up the pieces of the <persName ref="per.110"
                            >man</persName>. The <persName ref="per.113">he-bear</persName> lay down
                        and held the pieces to his breast. The <persName ref="per.112"
                            >she-bear</persName> lay on top of them to warm them. They worked over
                        the dead <persName ref="per.110">man</persName> with medicine, and often the
                        bears Would pray, "Father, help me." After a while the <persName
                            ref="per.110">man</persName> began to move and then he became conscious
                        and had life.</p>
                    <p>When he opened his eyes, the <persName ref="per.113">he-bear</persName> said,
                        "It is not through me, but the <persName ref="per.112">she-bear</persName>,
                        that you have been brought back to life. You are not yet well and whole. You
                        must come and live with us, until your wounds are healed." Although the
                            <persName ref="per.110">man</persName> was very weak and would faint and
                        fall dawn, the bears took him with them to a cave in the rocks among the
                        cedars. Here wore their young that they had left when they started out.</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="per.110">man</persName> lived with the bears until his
                        wounds had healed. The bears taught him everything they knew. The <persName
                            ref="per.113">he-bear</persName> said to the <persName ref="per.110"
                            >man</persName>, "I am going to make you great, but do not think that I
                        can do great things of myself. I look above to the giver of all power. I
                        shall take you home and I want you to imitate us. That shall be a part of
                        your greatness. I shall look after you and give you a part of myself. If I
                        am killed, you shall be killed; if I grow old, you shall grow old. Look at
                        that tree that <persName ref="per.004">Tirawa</persName> made. It is always
                        green and young. Take some of it with you, and whenever it thunders and
                        lightens throw some on the fire and let the smoke rise."</p>
                    <p>The bears made a bearskin cap to cover his naked skull. Soon they set out
                        upon their journey. When they reached the village it was night. The
                            <persName ref="per.113">bear</persName> said, "Go into the village and
                        get me a piece of <name type="animal">buffalo</name> meat, a blue bead, some
                        Indian tobacco, and some sweet smelling clay." When the <persName
                            ref="per.110">man</persName> went into the village his father was
                        surprised and glad to see him; he had supposed that the whole party had been
                        killed. Then the <persName ref="per.110">man</persName> went back to the
                            <persName ref="per.113">bear</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Before they parted the <persName ref="per.113">bear</persName> hugged him,
                        put his head against the <persName ref="per.110">man</persName>'s cheek, and
                        said, "My fur that has touched you will bless you and make you great." He
                        drew his paws down the <persName ref="per.110">man's</persName> arms until
                        they came to his hands and then he said, "I have rubbed my hands over you so
                        that you shall be tough and fear nothing. Because my mouth has touched yours
                        you shall be wise."</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="per.110">man</persName> became the greatest of warriors.
                        he originated the <name type="animal">bear</name> dance celebrated among the
                            <orgName ref="trb.004">Pawnee</orgName>. He died of old age; the
                            <persName ref="per.113">bear</persName> died at the same time.</p>

                    <p>Sometime before the white men came among them, the various bands of the
                            <orgName ref="trb.004">Pawnee</orgName> Indians lived in separate
                        villages. One <name type="season">winter</name> the <orgName ref="trb.006"
                            >Kitkehahki</orgName> band roamed over the country after <name
                            type="animal">buffalo</name>, but they were unable to find any. The
                        women and children cried from hunger.</p>
                    <p>One of the young <persName ref="per.114">men</persName> felt very sorry for
                        the sufferers and said to the <persName ref="per.115">Head Chief</persName>,
                        "I think I can help then. Let them set up a new lodge to meet in outside the
                        village." The <persName ref="per.115">chief</persName> gave orders to have
                        this done.</p>
                    <p>While the lodge was being built, this <persName ref="per.114">man</persName>
                        would disappear in the night, returning it dawn. Sometimes as he sat in his
                        lodge he would reach behind him and bring out a small piece of <name
                            type="animal">buffalo</name> meat and give it to someone, saying, "When
                        you have had enough to give what is left to someone else.” Although the
                        piece was small and the person hungry, there was always some left to give
                        away.</p>
                    <p>It was the <persName ref="per.115">Head Chief's</persName> custom to ride
                        through the village occasionally, urging the people to do right by each
                        other. He announced that this <persName ref="per.114">man</persName> was
                        going to try to help people. Many gave him presents and each one said, "Try
                        to help us."</p>
                    <p>When they were gathered together in the new lodge the <persName ref="per.114"
                            >man</persName> said, "I thank you for these presents; I shall give them
                        to the one who gives me power. In four days, help will come."</p>
                    <p>Every night he disappeared and came back. He said he had been far away. When
                        he returned the fourth night, he told the people that the <name
                            type="animal">buffalo</name> were near. On a hill he sacrificed some
                        eagle feathers, blue beads, and Indian tobacco. When he returned to the camp
                        he said, "When an object comes to that place of sacrifice do not turn it
                        back. Just watch.”</p>
                    <p>The next morning at daylight the people were all in front of their lodges
                        watching the place of sacrifice. As they looked a great <name type="animal"
                            >buffalo</name> bull came over the hill, stood there a short time,
                        walked down the hill, and galloped off past the village. Then the <persName
                            ref="per.114">man</persName> said, "That is the leader; the whole herd
                        will follow."</p>
                    <p>He told the chiefs to send four boys to the top of the hill to look for <name
                            type="animal">buffalo</name>. They came running back and went to the
                        chiefs’ lodge and said, “A herd of <name type="animal">buffalo</name> are
                        coming!”</p>
                    <p>Then the <persName ref="per.115">chief</persName> rode through the village
                        and told everyone to make ready for the chase. He said,” Do not leave
                        anything on the killing ground. Bring the best portions to the new lodge and
                        we shall have a feast there.”</p>
                    <p>When the <name type="animal">buffalo</name> came over the hill, the Indians
                        surrounded them and killed a great number. Each man brought the best
                        portions of his meat to the new lodge, and for four days and nights they
                        feasted. The <persName ref="per.114">man</persName> said, “We shall make
                        three more surrounds. See that none of the meat is wasted. <persName
                            ref="per.004">Tirawa</persName> does not like waste.” Each night he
                        disappeared.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="p004" facs="nefl.06.004.jpg"/>
                    <p>On the fourth night he said, “Tomorrow the <name type="animal">buffalo</name>
                        will come again. Be careful not to kill the little yellow <name
                            type="animal"><orig>calf</orig><reg>buffalo</reg></name> that you will
                        see with its mother.” They made the second surround and let the <name
                            type="animal"><orig>calf</orig><reg>buffalo</reg></name> and its mother
                        go.</p>
                    <p>The tribe saw that this <persName ref="per.114">man</persName> was great.
                        They gave him presents, including their best <name type="animal"
                            >horses</name>.</p>
                    <p>In the second surround, they again killed a great many <name type="animal"
                            >buffalo</name>. Their sacks were full; dried meat was piled out of
                        doors.</p>
                    <p>As they were about to make this third surround the wind changed, the <name
                            type="animal">buffalo</name> smelt them and stampeded. The <persName
                            ref="per.114">man</persName> ran up to the place of sacrifice carrying a
                        pole on which was tied the skin of a kit <name type="animal">fox</name>. He
                        waved the pole and called out “Ska-a-a!” The <name type="animal"
                            >buffalo</name> turned about and ran toward the hunters. Many were
                        killed.</p>
                    <p>After this surround, the <persName ref="per.114">man</persName> called the
                        chiefs and asked, “Are you satisfied?” They answered, “We are satisfied and
                        thankful to you. Through you the tribe has been saved from starvation.” He
                        said, “you will make one more surround. Get all you can for that will be the
                        last of the <name type="animal">buffalo</name> this <name type="season"
                            >winter</name>. The presents you gave me I give back.” But the people
                        would not let him return the presents.</p>
                    <p>During the fourth surround the people again killed many <name type="animal"
                            >buffalo</name> and saved the meat. That night the <persName
                            ref="per.114">man</persName> disappeared again. The next morning he
                        asked the people if they could see any <name type="animal">buffalo</name>,
                        but they could not.</p>
                    <p>The next day the Indians broke up camp and started east toward their home.
                        They had so much meat that they had to make two trips for it. They usually
                        had no fresh meat, but when this <persName ref="per.114">man</persName> came
                        in he would always bring in a little piece of meat and divide it among the
                        people. After it was boiled, everyone would eat, but they could not eat it
                        all up. The <persName ref="per.114">man</persName> could even change buffalo
                        chips into meat. He would cover them with his robe and when he took it off
                        there would be buffalo meat and pemmican.</p>
                    <p>The people wanted this great <persName ref="per.114">man</persName> to marry
                        a chief’s daughter and raise children so that his stock would not run out,
                        but he did not do so.</p>
                    <p>Once more he saved the tribe from starvation. The second time the suffering
                        was so great that they called a council and asked him to help. He consented
                        to help, and again brought the <name type="animal">buffalo</name>, allowing
                        them to make four surrounds.</p>
                    <p>When the <persName ref="per.114">man</persName> died, all the people mourned
                        for him. The <persName ref="per.115">chief</persName> rode around the
                        village and called out, “I am poor in mind on account of this <persName
                            ref="per.114">man’s</persName> death.”</p>

                    <p><title><hi rend="all_caps">A Story of Faith</hi></title></p>
                    <p>Once long ago before the <orgName ref="trb.004">Pawnee</orgName> had doctors’
                        dances, there was a certain small <persName ref="pers.116">boy</persName> in
                        one of the tribes. He had peculiar ways and kept to himself. His mother or
                        father sometimes found him with mud smeared over his face and head. This was
                        a sign of a doctor, showing that the <persName ref="pers.116">boy</persName>
                        had faith in the earth from which roots used for medicine are taken.</p>
                    <p>His parents did not understand his ways, but they did not interfere. After he
                        had grown up he seemed very thoughtful. He would often sit by himself
                        fasting and praying. His father, who was a brave but not a chief, was
                        well-to-do and had plenty of <name type="animal">horses</name>.</p>
                    <p>When anyone fell ill, this young <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName>
                        would go to them and cure them. The doctors in the tribe wondered how he
                        could do this: he had never been taught by them. He did not want to be with
                        the doctors. He preferred to be alone. Some of the bad doctors became
                        jealous of him. They had great influence because the people believed they
                        could lay a curse on a man.</p>
                    <p>His name became so great that it was well known among the other bands of
                            <orgName ref="trb.004">Pawnee</orgName>. A great <persName
                            ref="pers.117">doctor</persName> from another village paid a visit to
                        this young <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> and to find out where he
                        got his knowledge and power. The young <persName ref="pers.116"
                            >man</persName> greeted him courteously and entertained him in his
                        lodge. The great <persName ref="pers.117">doctor</persName> said, “You may
                        come to me for advice.” Although it was contrary to <orgName ref="trb.004"
                            >Pawnee</orgName> customs, they smoked the doctor’s tobacco all night
                        long. In the morning he departed.</p>
                    <p>A short time after the <persName ref="pers.117">doctor</persName> left, the
                        young <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> began to be ill. He felt
                        drowsy and heavy and seemed to be swelling up with some strange disease. The
                            <persName ref="pers.117">doctor</persName> had poisoned him in some way.
                        The <persName ref="pers.116">boy</persName> felt disgraced and did not know
                        what to do. He prayed and fasted for several days at a time, and was so
                        despondent that he thought of killing himself. He did not tell his trouble
                        to anyone.</p>
                    <p>He went out on a hill to meditate and pray, and had not returned when the
                        tribe set out on a hunt. The father left a horse in the village upon which
                        he might follow the tribe. When he came back, the village was empty except
                        for a fine <name type="animal">horse</name> which his father had left for
                        him. He did not follow the tribe, however, but rode eastward for several
                        days.</p>
                    <p>One day he stopped and tied his <name type="animal">horse</name> to a tree
                        and prayed aloud, “My Father, through you I live and through you that
                            <persName ref="pers.117">man</persName> put me in this condition. You
                        are the ruler and nothing is impossible to you. I pray you take this illness
                        from me.” Then he said, “To you, <name type="animal">fish</name> of the
                        rivers, you, <name type="animal">birds</name> of the air, you animals that
                        move upon the earth, and you, oh Sun! I offer up this animal. If you have
                        any power, intercede for me.” After saying this he stabbed his <name
                            type="animal">horse</name> and killed it. He placed it upright on its
                        knees and skinned it that the animals might feed upon it.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="p006" facs="nefl.06.006.jpg"/>
                    <p>Although the tribe was camped on the <placeName ref="tgn_2615042">Republican
                            River</placeName> he went on to a hill by the <placeName
                            ref="tgn_2677501">Platte River</placeName> called <placeName
                            ref="tgn_2684746">Pahuk</placeName> by the Indians. As he felt very
                        badly he stayed there several days. One night, having fallen asleep
                        exhausted by weeping and praying, he was awakened by a voice saying, “What
                        are you doing here?” A second and a third night he had the same experience
                        and each time he saw no one. On the third night he answered the voice,
                        saying, “Whoever speaks to me, take pity on me.”</p>
                    <p>As he lay with his head toward the east on the fourth night, something
                        touched his shoulder. When he looked up he saw a large animal with big black
                        eyes and a whitish body, (Pah) an <persName ref="per.118"
                        >elk</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="per.118">elk</persName> said, “Right here under you is the
                        home of the (<persName ref="per.005">Nahurac</persName>) animals. We know
                        your trouble. If one animal’s home fails to help you, I will take you to
                        another; if that fails, to another. If they cannot help you we still have
                        the One above.” Having said these things he vanished.</p>
                    <p>As the <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> sat absorbed in thought a
                        voice roused him. It said, “I have passed here many times and have heard you
                        crying.” Looking up he saw sitting by him a little <persName ref="pers.119"
                            >bird</persName> blue above white below, with red legs. The <persName
                            ref="pers.116">boy</persName> replied, “Oh, my brother, you understand;
                        take pity on me.” The <persName ref="pers.119">bird</persName> said, “You
                        must not talk that way to me. I am only a servant. Tomorrow night I will
                        come again and whatever I do, you do also.” The <persName ref="pers.119"
                            >bird</persName> disappeared and the <persName ref="pers.116"
                            >man</persName> felt a little hopeful.</p>
                    <p>The next night when the time came the <persName ref="pers.119"
                            >bird</persName> flew close and said, “Come, we will go to the edge of
                        the cut bank.” When they reached the edge the <persName ref="pers.119"
                            >bird</persName> said, “Do as I do.” So when the <persName
                            ref="pers.119">bird</persName> dived off the cut bank, the <persName
                            ref="pers.116">man</persName> followed. As he sprang he felt like a
                            <persName ref="pers.119">bird</persName> and could sail this way and
                        that. When he reached the water it seemed that he was standing in the
                        entrance of a lodge and could see the fire burning within.</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="pers.119">bird</persName> flew in ahead of him and said,
                        “Here he is.” As he stepped forward the bears
                        growled and the other animals all made sounds. Although a bear stood ready to seize him on one side of the
                        entrance and on the other a snake was rattling,
                        coiled as if to strike, something behind seemed to push him ahead. Knowing
                        that he must enter, he looked neither to the right nor the left but walked
                        straight ahead. As he passed them they sank back and were quiet. Then the
                            <persName ref="per.005">Nahurac</persName> made a noise of welcome.
                        Looking around he saw all kinds of animals--beaver, garfish, otter, and a sandhill crane. The
                            <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> looked very pitiful, and the
                        <persName ref="pers.119">bird</persName> servant said, “I have taken pity on this
                            <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> and I want you to take pity on
                        him.” It was very quiet; as the <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName>
                        looked about he saw all the animals roll their eyes. Then the <persName ref="pers.119">bird</persName> stood up and said, “My rulers, I am your
                        servant and am always obedient. I am weary of the crying of this poor-minded
                            <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName>. Pity him because I pity
                        him.”</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="pers.119">bird</persName> took the young man’s pipe,
                        walked over to the <persName ref="pers.120">beaver</persName>, the head doctor, and
                        held it out to him. The <persName ref="pers.120">beaver</persName> stretched out his
                        hand and withdrew it; as the bird continued to cry, the <persName ref="pers.120">beaver</persName> took the pipe. All the animals were pleased. The <persName ref="pers.120">beaver</persName> said, “I take pity on my ser<pb
                            xml:id="p007" facs="nefl.06.007.jpg"/>vant, but it is impossible for me
                        to promise to help this <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName>.” He passed
                        the pipe to the next doctor who said, “I am poor; I have not much power.”
                        The pipe went around the circle. The white <persName ref="pers.120">beaver</persName>
                        then said, “None of us have the power to help you. There is another lodge at
                            <placeName ref="tgn_2362937">Pahowa</placeName>. Go there.” The
                            <persName ref="per.005">Nahurac</persName> made medicine and when the
                        young <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> awoke he was lying on the hill
                        where he had slept the night before.</p>
                    <p>He wept all day. The <persName ref="pers.118">elk</persName> came at night and said,
                        “Go to sleep and I will take you to <placeName ref="tgn_2362937"
                            >Pahowa</placeName>.” The <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> slept;
                        next morning he awoke on the point of <placeName ref="tgn_2362937"
                            >Pahowa</placeName>. That night the <persName ref="pers.119"
                            >bird</persName> came and dived into a spring. As the young <persName
                            ref="pers.116">man</persName> followed, he found himself again at the
                        door of a lodge. The same thing happened and the animal doctors told him of
                        another lodge on the west side of the <placeName ref="tgn_1130227">Loup
                            River</placeName>. He went to sleep and awakened on top of the ground
                        near <placeName ref="tgn_2362937">Pahowa</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>That night the <persName ref="pers.118">elk</persName> took him while he slept to a
                        place near the bank of the <placeName ref="tgn_1130227">Loup
                            River</placeName>. The <persName ref="pers.119">bird</persName> led him
                        over the bank to the <persName ref="per.005">Nahurac</persName> lodge at
                        that place. Here were the same head doctors. They could not help him and
                        told him to go to an island in the <placeName ref="tgn_2677501"
                            >Platte</placeName> near Lone Tree (<placeName ref="tgn_2062028">Central
                                City</placeName>). The <persName ref="pers.118">elk</persName> took him to the
                        island and the <persName ref="pers.119">bird</persName> led him to the lodge under
                        the center of the island. They sent him back to the lodge at <placeName
                            ref="tgn_2684746">Pahuk</placeName> which the <persName ref="pers.120">beaver</persName> told him was the head lodge.</p>
                    <p>He reached the lodge at <placeName ref="tgn_2684746">Pahuk</placeName> in the
                        same manner as he had before. The animals were glad to see him. This time
                        the <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> himself asked the animals to
                        help him. The white <persName ref="pers.120">beaver</persName> took the pipe and
                        said, “My brother, I have done this to see if any of the other lodges were
                        equal to me. I have an animal who will undertake to rid you of your
                        trouble.” He walked to a certain ground <persName ref="pers.121">dog</persName> and
                        held out the pipe. The ground <persName ref="pers.121">dog</persName> hesitated a
                        long time. At last he reached out his paws, and the <persName ref="per.005"
                            >Nahurac</persName> made a very big noise.</p>
                    <p>The ground <persName ref="pers.121">dog</persName> said, “I have accepted this pipe
                        for the sake of our servant who has been so faithful to our commands. And if
                        I fail now, we can do nothing for him.”</p>
                    <p>After the doctors had smoked, they told the young <persName ref="pers.116"
                            >man</persName> to sit down between them and the fire. These twelve
                        animals paced back and forth. At length the head doctor told him to stand
                        and asked the other <persName ref="per.005">Nahurac</persName> to sing. The
                        ground <name type="animal">dogs</name> danced, made their hands go up and
                        down, made their jaws go as if eating but they did not open their mouths.
                        Next they told him to lie down with his feet toward the entrance. The head
                        ground <persName ref="pers.121">dog</persName> jumped over the man’s belly and seemed
                        to be eating a big piece of flesh. Each one ran and jumped over the
                            <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> and as they jumped each one was
                        eating a piece of flesh. As they were jumping, the swelling gradually
                        disappeared from the young <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The head ground <persName ref="pers.121">dog</persName> said, “Now, <persName
                            ref="per.005">Nahurac</persName>, you see the power I have. That is the
                        reason I do not travel on top of the ground. My appetite would overpower me
                        and I would kill men and eat them.”</p>
                    <pb xml:id="p008" facs="nefl.06.008.jpg"/>
                    <p>The young <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> had been unconscious since
                        he first lay down. The ground dogs did not know
                        how to restore him. The head doctor, the <persName ref="pers.120">beaver</persName>,
                        said to the bears, “This <persName ref="pers.116"
                            >man</persName> belongs to you. Let me see what you can do.” The head
                            <persName ref="pers.122">bear</persName> said, “Very well. I will let you see
                        what I can do.” First the bears began to sing.
                        Then the head <persName ref="pers.122">bear</persName> jumped on the <persName
                            ref="pers.116">man</persName> and acted as if he were going to tear him
                        to pieces. The other took hold of him and shook him until at last his blood
                        began to circulate and he began to breathe. After a while he regained
                        consciousness. He felt as he had many months before and he found that his
                        trouble was gone. The head <persName ref="pers.122">bear</persName> stood by him and
                        said, “<persName ref="per.005">Nahurac</persName>, you have seen what I can
                        do. However dangerously wounded I may be I know how to cure myself if I have
                        any breath left in me.” The bears then sat down
                        in their places.</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> arose and thanked the <persName
                            ref="per.005">Nahurac</persName>. He stayed several days observing their
                        ceremonies. They taught him their ways and their secrets. One day the head
                        doctor said, “I wish to ask a favor of you in return for what we have done.”
                        The <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> agreed, and the head doctor
                        continued, “See that my animals that move in the river are fed. I move in
                        the water. You live in the air but we live where there is no air. The heaven
                        is the house of <persName ref="per.004">Tirawa</persName> and we all live
                        inside of it. When you do the things we have taught, you must blow a smoke
                        to each of these head doctors, and to <persName ref="per.004"
                            >Tirawa</persName> you must blow four smokes. Blow four to the night and
                        to the east, for something may then foretell events to you while you sleep.
                        Now, go home and after a short time pay a visit to the <persName
                            ref="pers.117">doctor</persName> who caused your trouble.”</p>
                    <p>The young <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> arrived home in the night.
                        His father had long mourned him as dead and was poor in mind on account of
                        it. He went into his father’s lodge and awakened him. His father said, “Is
                        it you or your ghost?” The son replied, “I am not a ghost.”</p>
                    <p>He asked his father to summon his uncles and other relatives and ask them to
                        bring a blue bead, a pipe, some Indian tobacco, and some buffalo meat. The relatives came to rejoice and bring the
                        presents. The <persName ref="pers.116">boy</persName> took the presents down
                        to the river and threw them in; they were carried to the <persName
                            ref="per.005">Nahurac</persName> lodge at <placeName ref="tgn_2684746"
                            >Pahuk</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>After a few days the young <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> mounted
                        his <name type="animal">horse</name> and went to visit the <persName
                            ref="pers.117">doctor</persName>. When he reached the village, someone
                        said to the <persName ref="pers.117">doctor</persName>, “There is a
                            <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> at your lodge.” The <persName
                            ref="pers.117">doctor</persName> was a little uneasy: he knew what he
                        had done to the <persName ref="pers.116">boy</persName>. He thought,
                        however, that he knew so much that no one could overcome him. He welcomed
                        the <persName ref="pers.116">boy</persName> and took him into his lodge.</p>
                    <p>After they had eaten the evening meal, the young <persName ref="pers.116"
                            >man</persName> said, “When you were at my lodge we smoked your tobacco;
                        tonight we will smoke mine.” While they smoked the <persName ref="pers.116"
                            >boy</persName> moved his jaws as if eating. At daylight the <persName
                            ref="pers.116">boy</persName> said he must go. When he reached the river
                        he blew upon the ice which immediately melted and was full of blood. The
                        young <persName ref="pers.116">man</persName> had learned the ground dogs’ secrets.</p>
                    <p>The people found the <persName ref="pers.117">doctor</persName> dead in his
                        lodge. He was hollow; his blood and insides had gone down the river to feed
                        the animals. The <persName ref="pers.116">boy</persName> had fulfilled his
                        promise to the <persName ref="per.005">Nahurac</persName> and had revenge
                        upon the <persName ref="pers.117">doctor</persName>.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="p009" facs="nefl.06.009.jpg"/>
                    <p>The <persName ref="pers.116">boy</persName> became the greatest doctor of his
                        band and taught his people the doctor’s ceremonies and many other wonderful
                        things.</p>

                            Brother</hi></title></p>
                    <p>Once long ago when a party of <orgName ref="trb.004">Pawnee</orgName> were on
                        the warpath, two brothers got lost in a thick woods. They could not find the
                        war party; so they decided to try to make their way home. Having no food,
                        they watched for berries or for something to kill. Finally they came upon a
                            <name type="animal">buffalo</name> which had been dead for some time.
                        There was no flesh left but the marrow was still in the bones. They took
                        some of these bones and carried them along.</p>
                    <p>They traveled some time before they came out of the woods. The sun had gone
                        down, so they stopped for the night. In a lone tree near by was a <name
                            type="animal">squirrel</name>. One of the boys shot him with his bow and
                        arrow, and they roasted him over a fire.</p>
                    <p>While the <name type="animal">squirrel</name> was cooking, the older <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName>
                        said, “I believe the <name type="animal">squirrel</name> and marrow will be
                        good together.”</p>
                    <p>The younger <persName ref="per.123">brother</persName> said, “This is not real meant,” (The Indians did not
                        consider that <name type="animal">squirrel</name> flesh was real meat like
                        the flesh of <name type="animal">buffalo</name> or <name type="animal"
                            >elk</name>). “I do not wish to eat them together. You eat them together
                        if you wish.” So the elder <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> ate them together, taking a bit of marrow
                        and then a bit of <name type="animal">squirrel</name>.</p>
                    <p>In the middle of the night the elder <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> awoke with a queer feeling in
                        his legs and feet. He discovered that they were grown together, round like a
                            <name type="animal">snake</name>, and had a rattle on the end. He woke
                        the younger <persName ref="per.123">brother</persName> and said, “There is something wrong with my feet and
                        legs.” The younger <persName ref="per.123">brother</persName> felt of his limbs and saw that he was changing
                        into a <name type="animal">snake</name>.</p>
                    <p>The elder <persName ref="per.007">boy</persName> thought about his <persName ref="per.123">brother</persName> alone on the prairie so far from
                        home. He began telling the younger <persName ref="per.123">brother</persName> what to do while he was still
                        able to talk. He said, “You will get home safely. I will be a <name
                            type="animal">snake</name> and remain here, yet I will protect you and
                        guide you. When I have changed entirely into a <name type="animal"
                            >snake</name>, carry me to that hole by the tree. When you get home,
                        tell father and mother what happened. I do not know whether it happened
                        because I ate the marrow and <name type="animal">squirrel</name> together or
                        whether it was to happen to me and I could not help it. Come back soon,
                        alone. Afterwards, whenever you wish to go on the warpath, come this way
                        with your party. I will help you.” While he was talking the change was
                        moving up his body. Then the <name type="animal">snake</name> boy said, “Put
                        the robe over my head for a little while.” When the younger <persName ref="per.123">boy</persName> took the
                        robe away his <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> had changed completely into a <name type="animal"
                            >snake</name>, its head as bread as two hands.</p>
                    <p>The boy picked up his snake <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> and placed him
                        on the ground before the hole. “Now, I am going home,” he said. “I do not
                        know the country through which I must go. Remember your promises and take
                        care of me.” He felt very sad, and did not wait to see the <persName ref="per.007">snake</persName> go into the hole; he started on his journey.
                        When he reached home he told his parents and other relatives what had
                        happened.</p>
                    <p>When the young man had been home about ten days he told his mother he was
                        going on the warpath by himself. He took five pairs of moccasins stuffed
                        full of parched corn, also a sack of pounded buffalo meat, and set out to see his <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName>.</p>
                    <p>After a week of fast traveling, he came to the place where he had left his
                        snake <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName>. He went to the hole and said,
                        “I am here, <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName>. I have come alone and I want to see you. Remember your
                        promises.” He heard a rattling, a rustling, and a scraping in the hole; then
                        out of the hole came a cloud of dust, followed by a huge <persName ref="per.007">snake</persName> that was his brother. Other <name type="animal"
                            >snakes</name> came out and crawled around, but the snake <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> remained by the hole. The <persName ref="per.123">boy</persName> took the big <persName ref="per.007">snake</persName> in his arms and hugged it and talked to it.
                        The <persName ref="per.007">snake</persName> put out his tongue to kiss him. The
                        young man put his snake <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> down; all the
                        other <name type="animal">snakes</name> went back into the hole, and the
                        snake <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> followed them.</p>
                    <p>The young <persName ref="per.123">man</persName> went on his way until sunset, when he came to a creek. Here he
                        stopped for the night. His snake <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> came to him in a dream and said, “I
                        am glad you came to see me; now I will help you. Tomorrow morning dress
                        yourself for fighting. Put the feathers on your head, and put on the
                        warpaint.”</p>
                    <p>The next morning when the <persName ref="per.123">boy</persName> awoke, he did as his <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> had told him.
                        After dressing himself to fight, he went on. When he reached the top of a
                        little hill, he saw some people and several <name type="animal"
                            >horses</name> coming toward him. He thought it was a small band of
                            <orgName ref="trb.005">Sioux</orgName>, so he went back and hid in the
                        bushes where he had slept. The party came nearer and camped just below his
                        hiding place. Peeking out from time to time, the <persName ref="per.123">boy</persName> saw there was only a
                        man and a woman and many <name type="animal">horses</name>.</p>
                    <p>After watching them for some time, he crept slowly through the brush until he
                        was about twenty yards away. Then he looked again. The woman was cooking. He
                        could not see the man, but bow and arrows were hanging in a tree. The man
                        was probably sleeping. As the boy watched he became very excited, thinking
                        of what he was about to do. As he watched, the woman went towards the <name
                            type="animal">horses</name> to drive them nearer the camp. When she came
                        back the boy left his hiding place and ran toward the woman. He was quite
                        near before she saw him. He told her to stand still or he would kill her. He
                        shot two arrows into her husband, who lay asleep almost at her feet, and
                        took his scalp.</p>
                    <p>He took the woman to where the <name type="animal">horses</name> were grazing
                        and made her mount a <name type="animal">horse</name>; then he got on
                        another. Driving the other <name type="animal">horses</name> before them, he
                        went back to where his snake <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> lived. He
                        tied the woman to the tree under which his <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> lived. He also tied a
                        spotted <name type="animal">horse</name> and a <name type="animal"
                            >mule</name> to the tree. Then he went to the hole where his <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName>
                        lived and said, “<persName ref="per.007">Brother</persName>, I thank you for helping me. I have brought these
                        two animals and the woman to you. They are yours. I would like to see you
                        before I 11 go away.” Soon he heard the rattling and saw a cloud of dust
                        coming from the hole. The snake <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> came out,
                        followed as usual by smaller <name type="animal">snakes</name> which climbed
                        the tree until they were thick above the <persName ref="per.123">boy’s</persName> head. The <persName ref="per.123">boy</persName> took his snake <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> up in his arms and hugged him, and
                        the <persName ref="per.007">snake</persName> touched the <persName ref="per.123">boy’s</persName> face with his tongue.
                        After a time the <persName ref="per.123">boy</persName> put the <persName ref="per.007">snake</persName> down and set
                        out on his long journey home.</p>
                    <p>Two or three days after the first war party visited the snake <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName>, they came upon a band of <orgName ref="trb.005"
                            >Sioux</orgName>, took a lot of <name type="animal">horses</name>, and
                        killed many of their enemies. They went back by way of the <persName ref="per.007">snake’s</persName> home, and left a <name type="animal"
                            >horse</name> and the scalps they had taken as presents to the snake <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The next time a war party went out, it happened that the <persName ref="per.123">boy</persName> could not go
                        along, but he said to them, “Go to my <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName>, leave presents, and ask his
                        help.” They did as the <persName ref="per.123">boy</persName> said and they were successful.</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="per.123">boy</persName> was always lucky in war. All the warriors wanted to go with him on
                        the warpath, for they knew his snake <persName ref="per.007">brother</persName> would help them. The <persName ref="per.123">boy</persName> grew
                        very rich, with many <name type="animal">horses</name>, and became a great
                        chief.</p>
