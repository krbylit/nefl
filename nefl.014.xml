                   <p> The following pages are devoted to those Nebraska place names that reveal interesting stories concerning their origin. In some instances the story of a locale's naming, as in the case of Weeping Water, derives from a folk legend. This, however, makes the story all the more interesting; since it is the tale, not the fact, in which we are interested in this pamphlet. Consequently all the hundreds of Nebraska places that have been named in honor of early settlers, railroad officials, or towns in other states have been omitted.</p>

                        Indians received its name from a tragedy which occurred many years ago before Cedar County was named.</p>
                    
                    <p> A young <persName ref="per.101">Indian maiden</persName> is supposed to have eloped with a young <persName ref="per.102">brave</persName> in order to avoid being forced into marriage with an old <persName ref="per.103">warrior</persName> whom she did not love. The old Indian, eager for revenge, collected a searching party from among his friends and succeeeded in apprehending the young <persName ref="per.101">maiden</persName>. The rejected suitor gave her a severe flogging which was continued until the girl's sympathizers came to her rescue. Bitter words and then a fight ensued between the two factions, ending in much bloodshed and many deaths.</p>
                    
                    <p> The result of the feud was a permanent separation of the tribe, with the sympathizers of the girl migrating southward.</p>

    <p>Some <persName ref="per.104">men</persName> who had been working in a field near the present town found a rusty cowbell "marred" in the mud. The incident suggested the appropriate name of Belmar when the village was named.</p>

    <p>One day, when a group of <persName ref="per.105">surveyers</persName>, headed by <persName ref="106">Mr. Robert Harvey</persName>, was working along the stream, a party of Indians in war dress was observed in the distance. The <persName ref="per.105">surveyers</persName> had no weapons with which to defend themselves in case of attack, so each man shouldered a surveying stake in military formation. The warriors left the vicinity without making a closer investigation of the bluff. <persName ref="per.106">Mr. Harvey</persName>, in a spirit of fun, printed the name Bloody Creek upon his field map.</p>

                    <p>So many people were killed in Sidney "with their boots on" during its pioneer days that the cemetery in which they were buried was named Boothill. In the 1880's, when most of the gold <persName ref="per.107">prospectors</persName> of the South Dakota Blackhills purchased their supplies in Sidney, it was not unusual for two or three murders to take place in one night. At this time twenty-three saloons were opened in one block, each one doing a flourishing business. Public dance halls were often operated in conjunction with the saloons. A man was shot in one of these halls one

<fw>3</fw>night, but instead of the incident stopping the dance it served to heighten the fun. The corpse was propped up in a corner where he became a stony spectator of the amusement. It was not until a third victim had been set up against the wall that the dancers decided the party was becoming a bit too rough even for them. The next morning three more corpses were buried in Boothill.</p>
                    <p>Lynching were another common way of swelling the Boothill's population. It is said that at one time the possibility of a stranger becoming a member of Boothill was so great that the Union Pacific Railroad refused to allow its passengers to get off the train at Sidney.</p>

After the third name had been rejected a settler named <persName ref="per.111">Wilson Hewitt</persName> found a broken bow on an old Indian hunting ground, which suggested the unusual name, Broken Bow. THe bow was almost destroyed when Hewitt's hired girl used it as kindling wood for starting a fire in the stove.

                    <p>One day, in the fall of 1879, three <persName ref="per.113">men</persName> were hunting deer in Loup County. The <persName ref="per.113">hunters</persName> tracked some deer to a gulch, where, upon catching sight of the animals the <persName ref="per.113">hunters</persName> immediately threw themselves on the ground, with one of the men, named <persName ref="per.114">Moore</persName>, stalking some twenty feet ahead of the others. At the moment <persName ref="per.114">Moore</persName> raised his head above the dark woods to aim at the deer, one of his <persName ref="per.113">companions</persName> pulled the trigger of his rifle. The top of Moore's head, at this close range, was blown off. The locality has ever since been known as Dead Man's Gulch or Dead Man's Gulch.</p>

                    <p>In the Platte River, east of where the town of Rogers is located in Colfax County, used to be an island known as Dead Men's Island. It was, in reality, little more than a sandbar, with fringes of grass at its edges and a few willows for its vegetation. The whole island has long since been washed away by the Platte's swirling waters, and its only interest now is how it came to get its name.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the early 1860's a band of <persName ref="per.115">sex horse thieves</persName> came into the Platte Valley from the southwest, raiding the corrals of the <persName ref="per.116">settlers</persName> in the section now embraced by western Dodge and eastern Colfax Counties. The settlers quickly formed a posse in pursuit of the <persName ref="per.115">gang</persName> with its stolen <name type="animal">horses</name>.</p>
                    
                    <p> In escaping, the <persName ref="per.115">thieves</persName> forced their <name type="animal">horses</name> into the Platte and made them swim to the island near the opposite shore. Here the <persName ref="per.115">men</persName> hoped to find refuge for the night, planning to escape to the south bank early the next morning before the posse could cross farther down the river and head them off.</p>
                    
                    <p>But the island was a bed of quicksand which began engulfing the <persName ref="per.115">men</persName> and <name type="animal">horses</name> as soon as they had set foot on it. Before the <persName ref="per.115">thieves</persName> realized their danger they were in the clutches of the sands. Their despairing shrieks rang out over the dark waters like the wails of damned souls. By morning the island was empty of all life; the sands had swallowed up both the <persName ref="per.115">thieves</persName> and their <name type="animal">horses</name>.</p>
                    
                    <p>For years afterward the <persName ref="per.116">settlers</persName> declared that on dark and rainy nights shrieks and groans could be heard from the island. The sandbar was appropriately named Dead Men's Island, and was pointed cut to those who traveled by, seeking locations farther west.</p>

                    <p>West of the village of Morse Bluffs is a peak which rooms high over the surrounding country. Its sides are covered by trees and grass, but the top, which is as level as a floor and about fifteen feet in diameter, is perfectly bare. No grass will grow on its apparently fertile black loam. The explanation for this arid space is found in an old legend that was told to the <persName ref="per.124">pioneers</persName> by the <orgName ref="trb.004">Pawnee</orgName> who once lived in this region. The legend is that a powerful <persName ref="per.123">Indian chief</persName> is buried at the top of the peak, and because he was a traitor and committed suicide no grass will grow upon his grave.</p>

In 1864, three years before Nebraska was admitted to the Union, political controversies became very intense over the reapportionment issue. After this had been settled the storm renewed its fury out the relocation of the capital. The North Platte faction--that is,

                    <fw>7</fw>
                        people living north of the Platte River--which included the large delegation from Omaha, used every stratagem and dodge they could think of to keep the capital in that city; while the South Platte group was equally determined to locate the seat of government somewhere south of the river. After numerous amendments, offered to delay action, had been steadily voted down to the South Platte party, the bill for relocation of the capital finally passed the House and was taken up by the Senate. In the Senate was a Senator <persName ref="per.128">Reeves</persName>, from the South Platte faction, who hated <persName ref="per.128">President Lincoln</persName>. Senator <persName ref="per.129">Patrick</persName> of Omaha, a member of the opposing camp, knew of Reeve's prejudice against the President, which caused him to make the teasing motion that the new capital's name be changed from Capital City to Lincoln. His amendment passed both houses, much to Reeve's chagrin and Patrick's delight.</p>
                    
                    <p>The family name Lincoln was derived from the ancient cathedral city in England. This city was first called Lydon or Lindon. The first syllable means lake or pool, the second hill-fort, and the Hill-Fort-by-the-Pool was a literal description of the barbaric stronghold. When the Romans took it over their engineers transformed the treacherous swamps into firm land; and built walls and a moat to make the place impregnable. The Romans added to the name, calling it Lindum Colonia, meaning a (Roman) settlement-at-the-mill-fort-by-the-pool. Later, because of so many dispatches to be sent back to Rome the name was abbreviated simply by crossing out many of the letters Lin<del>dun</del>col<del>o</del>n<del>ia</del>. In the Anglo-Saxon era the name may have been Lindocycllancoaster, meaning a fort built partly of stone. There were at least 12 changes of spelling for the name and standardized spelling was developed only after English became a modern language. The first Lincoln in Massachusetts was named for Lincoln, England in 1754. In 1854 New Hampshire gave the name to a village, and in 1790 Vermont also had a Lincoln post office.</p>
                    
                    <p>Probably no family name in America has been so greatly honored with such wide distribution. The Post Office Department has a list of over 40, most of which were named for <persName ref="per.127">Abraham Lincoln</persName>, though there were other Lincolns beside and before Abraham; for example, several Lincolns are named for Lovi, Lovi Jr., Enoch or Benjamin Lincoln. Abraham was a descendent of the Lovi family who came west from Hingham, Mass. to Jefferson County, Ky. Counting centers and cities, dales and vales, places, parks, and ridges, Maine and Pennsylvania have 4 each; Indiana, Illinois and several others have 2 or 3 each. There are 20 Lincoln counties in the various states, and there are countless precincts, townships, schools, universities, lakes, streams, parks and streets.</p>

    <p>The meaning of <hi rend="underline">Omaha</hi> is a <persName ref="per.135">white man's</persName> corruption of <hi rend="underline">umo ha</hi>, which means "against the current" or "upstream." The name is supposed to refer to the time, several hundred years ago, when the Omaha parted company with another tribe.</p>
                    
    <p>The *<hi rend="underline">Twenty-Seventh Annual Report, Bureau of American Ethnology</hi>, p. 36, says: "There are two versions of how this parting came about. One account says that the people were moving down the Uhai ke river (Ohio), 'The-River-Down-Which-They-Came'. When they came to a wide river, they made skin boats in which to cross the river. As they were crossing a storm came up. The <orgName ref="trb.011">Omaha</orgName> and <orgName ref="trb.012">Iowa</orgName> got safely across, but the <orgName ref="trb.013">Quapaw</orgName> drifted down the stream and were never seen again until within the last century. When the <orgName ref="trb.011">Omaha</orgName> made their landing, they camped in a sandy place. The strong wind blew the sand over the people and gave them a grayish appearance. From this circumstance they called themselves <hi rend="underline">Paxude</hi>, 'gray head,' and the <orgName ref="trb.011">Omaha</orgName> have known them by that name ever since</p>
    <fw>........</fw>
    <p> "The other version of the parting between the <orgName ref="trb.011">Omaha</orgName> and the <orgName ref="trb.013">Quapaw</orgName> is that when the wide river was reached the people made a rope of grape vines. They fastened one end on the eastern bank and the other end was taken by strong swimmers and carried across the river and fastened to the western bank. The people crossed the river by clinging to the grapevine. When about half their number were across, including the <orgName ref="trb.012">Iowa</orgName> and <orgName ref="trb.011">Omaha</orgName>, the rope broke, leaving the rest of the people behind. Those who were left were the <orgName ref="trb.013">Quapaw</orgName>. This crossing made on a foggy morning, and those left behind, believing that their companions who had crossed had followed the river downward on the western side, they themselves turned downstream on the eastern side, and so the two groups lost sight of each other."</p>

    <p>Another version, which comes from folklore, is that two branches of the same tribe fought a battle on the ground where the city of Omaha is now located. All but one of the warriors in one faction were killed. This lone <persName ref="per.136">survivor</persName> was thrown into the muddy Missouri. As his enemies gathered along the river's banks to enjoy his drowning struggles, he rose above the whirling waters, held up one arm and shouted "O-ma-ha" at the top of his voice. The word had never been heard before, but as the supposedly drowning Indian immediately swam to the opposite shore and escaped; his victorious enemies interpreted it to mean "on top of the water" or "upstream." The victorious <persName ref="per.137">warriors</persName>, who had come to admire their lone enemy's courage, called themselves to the <orgName ref="trb.011">Omaha</orgName> from that time on.</p>

                    <p>This city has the amusing speculation of wondering if it is named for a man who descended from the British royal family and who might himself have become the King of England. The city was named for <persName ref="per.138">General E.C. Ord</persName>, who was commander of the army in this territory during the Indian days. <persName ref="per.138">General Ord</persName>'s father, <persName ref="per.139">James Ord</persName>, was supposed to have been a son of the Prince of Wales who later became <persName ref="per.140">George IV of England</persName>. In 1905, a box, said to have been sealed by <persName ref="per.141">Lady Fitzhugh</persName> a century before, was opened according to the directions of the lady. It contained the couple's marriage license. The story, as told, is that a son had been born who was placed in charge of a servant named Ord. When the servant emigrated to the United States he took the boy along. <persName ref="per.139">James Ord</persName> asserted he was that son, and therefore the rightful heir to the British throne. But the face that he had fought against the British in 1912 and his affiliation with the Catholic Church barred him from the succession. The other obstacle was <persName ref="per.142">Queen Victoria</persName>, who, according to <persName ref="per.139">Ord</persName>, was too selfish to give her crown to its rightful owner.</p>
                    
                    <p> Even so, <persName ref="per.139">Ord</persName> expected to be eventually called to the throne. His room was plastered with newspaper prints of the English nobility so that when he became king he wouldn't be embarrassed by not recognizing his lords at sight.</p>

In the party was a young <persName ref="per.146">New Yorker</persName> who had declared, when he joined them in Council Bluffs, that he would kill the first Indian he saw in Nebraska. At the time no attention was paid to his ridiculous boast, and it was forgotten. But on this morning a <orgName ref="trb.004">Pawnee</orgName> girl came to trade with the white travelers from a friendly Indian camp located farther up the stream. As she approached the <persName ref="per.145">travelers</persName> the boastful <persName ref="per.146">New Yorker</persName> reached for his rifle and shot her.

<p>In the early eighties a party of <persName ref="per.149">trappers</persName> came down the North Platte River in canoes.

<p>A year later another group of trappers found <persName ref="per.150">Scott</persName>'s skeleton near the high bluff which now bears his name. Sick, starving and abandoned by

<p>Long ago a peaceful tribe, governed by a wise and brave  <persName ref="per.162">chief</persName>,
    <pb xml:id="p014" facs="nefl.14.014.jpg"/>

lived near the headwaters of the stream. The <persName ref="per.164">warriors</persName> were strong and peace-loving. The <persName ref="per.165">maidens</persName> were as lovely as the morning flowers. The chief's <persName ref="per.163">daughter</persName> was the fairest of them all. Her beauty was known among all the tribes of the prairie.</p>

                    <p> One day the <persName ref="per.166">chief</persName> of a war-loving tribe from the west was passing by on a hunting expedition. He saw the chief's daughter and asked for her hand in marriage. her <persName ref="per.162">father</persName> disliked the martial chief and refused. The <persName ref="per.166">chief</persName> became very angry and rode away without smoking the pipe of friendship. He spoke words of great hatred to his warriors as he rode out of the village. </p>

<p>Early one morning the <persName ref="per.163">maiden</persName> was bathing with her companions in a small stream near the village. A group of warriors from the war-loving tribe abducted her, stifling her screams in a blanket.</p>

                    <p>Another group of warriors encircled and attacked the group, slaughtering the unprepared warriors. Battle-cries and screams of terror echoed from the hills. The enemy rode off, leaving only the women of the tribe alive.</p>

<p>The women of the desolate village wept all that day and all that night. When they prepared their dead for burial on the next day they wept more. Swollen by tears the trickle of water which passed their village became a small stream and then a creek.</p>
                    <p>Today the inhabitants of Weeping Water look at one another when rain begins to fall and remark, "The squaw's memory of the battle will never die."</p>

Nearly starved, they were forced to give up their hunting expedition and return to their camp on the Niobrara. Before they had time to reach their tepees, a severe blizzard forced them to seek shelter under a small bluff near the head of a creek. While they huddle near its walls, half starved and half frozen, they heard the tunes of the <orgName ref="trb.003">Dakota</orgName> war song mingling with the roar of the storm. Investigation revealed the whistler, a member of their own tribe, benumbed and nearly crazed by the icy cold, who was attempting to keep up his spirits by whistling the martial song of his people.</p>

<p>When leading their fellow warrior back to their sheltered refuge they stumbled over the half-decayed carcass of an old buffalo bull. The Dakota's, desperate in their hunger, cut up the least decayed portion of the buffalo with their long hunting knives and ate it raw.</p>

                    <p>The entire group promptly became poisoned form the rotten meat,
